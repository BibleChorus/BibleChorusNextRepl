# Progress Page Visual Improvements Summary

## Overview
Fixed multiple visual issues on the progress.tsx page to create a more cohesive, modern, and visually appealing design that matches the overall application aesthetic.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Spacing on Book Percentages (Mobile View)
**Problem**: The percentage display in the mobile list view had inconsistent spacing and sizing issues.

**Solution**: 
- Reduced text size from `text-2xl` to `text-lg` for better mobile readability
- Added `flex flex-col items-end` with `min-w-[80px]` for consistent alignment
- Added `leading-tight` for better text spacing
- Removed duplicate percentage display in the progress bar section

**Files Modified**: `pages/progress.tsx`

### 2. Pie Chart Section Aesthetic
**Problem**: The pie charts didn't match the modern design theme of the rest of the application.

**Solutions**:
- **Card Styling**: Updated to use glassmorphism design with `bg-white/60 dark:bg-slate-800/60 backdrop-blur-xl`
- **Header Enhancement**: Added gradient icon, improved typography with gradient text, added descriptive subtitle
- **Content Wrapper**: Added background gradient overlay and improved spacing
- **Individual Chart Cards**: Wrapped each pie chart in styled containers with hover effects
- **Color Scheme**: Changed chart colors from purple theme to emerald/teal gradient to match the application theme
- **Typography**: Updated chart titles to use gradient text styling

**Files Modified**: 
- `components/ProgressPage/PieChartGroup.tsx`
- `components/ProgressPage/PieChartCard.tsx`
- `styles/globals.css`

### 3. Filter Aesthetic Updates
**Problem**: Filters looked outdated and didn't match the modern glassmorphism design.

**Solutions**:
- **Header Section**: Added gradient icon and improved layout with descriptive text
- **Button Styling**: Applied glassmorphism effects with backdrop blur and subtle borders
- **Dropdown Styling**: Enhanced with rounded corners, backdrop blur, and emerald accent colors
- **Interactive States**: Added smooth transitions and hover effects
- **Spacing**: Increased gaps between elements for better visual hierarchy

**Files Modified**: `components/ProgressPage/Filters.tsx`

### 4. Spacing Above Community Progress Tracking
**Problem**: Insufficient spacing between the info banner and the main content sections.

**Solution**:
- Increased margin-bottom from `mb-8` to `mb-10` on the info banner
- Increased gap between main content sections from `gap-8` to `gap-10`
- Adjusted main content top margin from `-mt-12` to `-mt-8` for better balance

**Files Modified**: `pages/progress.tsx`

### 5. Additional Design Improvements

  - Light mode: `--chart-purple: 158 64% 52%` (emerald)
  - Dark mode: `--chart-purple: 158 64% 52%` (emerald)
  - Improved uncovered section colors for better contrast

#### Visual Hierarchy
- Applied consistent gradient text styling across all section headers
- Added gradient background overlays for better content separation
- Enhanced badge styling with glassmorphism effects
- Improved accordion styling for mobile pie chart view

#### Interactive Elements
