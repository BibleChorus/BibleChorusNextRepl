The purpose of this book is plain and urgent: <b>to warn believers that continuing in known sin, such as pornography or drunkenness, puts their salvation in jeopardy.</b> Scripture gives no guarantee that a person delaying repentance will find it later. <i>“Today if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts”</i> (Hebrews 3:15, NASB) – this plea rings out because tomorrow is not promised. God’s word insists that <b>now</b> is the time to repent and obey, <i>“Behold, now is ‘the acceptable time,’ behold, now is ‘the day of salvation’”[<sup>biblehub.com</sup></i>](https://biblehub.com/nasb/2_corinthians/6-2.htm#:~:text=NASB%201995%20for%20He%20says%2C,THE%20DAY%20OF%20SALVATION)</i>. A Christian who persists in willful sin is presuming on God’s grace and <b>may awaken too late</b> to the reality that grace does not excuse ongoing disobedience. Many will be lost because they misapply doctrines like <i>sola fide</i> (faith alone) or <i>“once saved, always saved,”</i> imagining that a one-time profession of faith or a general love of sound doctrine will save them even as they <i>“go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth”</i> – a choice for which <i>“there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins”[<sup>nasb.literalword.com</sup></i>](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=Hebrews+10%3A26-39#:~:text=26%20For%20if%20we%20go,a%20terrifying%20thing%20to%20fall)</i>. The loving but firm warning of this book is that we must not deceive ourselves: <b>continued rebellion, even under the banner of Christianity, leads to eternal death</b>. <i>“If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit”</i> (Galatians 5:25 NASB); if instead we make peace with sin, we risk being severed from Christ. Repent now, while God’s patience calls out to you.

To impress the urgency of repentance, consider two realistic scenarios of believers who *“misunderstand grace”* and delay turning from their sin:

**Scenario 1 – The “Struggling” Young Christian:** A young man in his twenties loves theology and confidently champions *sola fide* – the doctrine that we are justified by faith alone. He is active in his church and delights in sound teaching. Outwardly, his life seems orderly. Inwardly, however, he battles a secret pattern of viewing pornography. He tells himself he’s *“struggling”* with this sin, as if the mere internal conflict were enough. After each lapse into lust, guilt floods his heart. He earnestly prays for forgiveness, confessing his sin to God with tears in his eyes. Yet he has done this **dozens or even hundreds** of times. By now a troubling routine has set in: temptation – failure – remorse – a promise to do better – and then a return to the same mire.

This young Christian truly believes in Jesus and cherishes the gospel of grace. He remembers that <i>“by grace [we] have been saved through faith… not as a result of works”</i> (Ephesians 2:8–9, NASB)<BibleVerse reference="Ephesians 2:8-10" />. He reassures himself that he is <i>“not saved by moral perfection.”</i> When accusing thoughts arise – <i>“How can you be a Christian and keep doing this?”</i> – he counters them with promises of God’s love and patience. In his mind, his pornography habit is a <b>flaw</b> or a <i>“struggle common to many men,”</i> not an outright rebellion. He does not <b>defend</b> pornography; he despises it and feels ashamed. Yet in the quiet of his heart, he also does not <b>forsake</b> it. He believes he’ll eventually overcome it, perhaps through accountability or marriage, but he feels no urgency to cut off this sin immediately. After all (he reasons), <i>everyone struggles, and God understands</i>. He takes a kind of misguided comfort in calling himself <i>“a wretch saved by grace,”</i> as if repeatedly quoting <i>“no one is righteous, not even one”</i> could excuse remaining in known impurity. His doctrine has taught him to distrust any hint of “works-based salvation,” so he shies away from preaching that seems too hard on sin. When he hears a sermon on Jesus’s warning – <i>“if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it from you”</i> (Matthew 5:30 NASB) – he feels a stab of conviction. But soon he relaxes, thinking, <i>“I do hate my sin. I’m just not perfect yet. Thank God for grace. I’ll repent for real someday.”</i> In this way, he lulls his conscience with half-truths. He has <b>good theology in theory</b>, but he is blind to the gravity of practicing what God hates. In effect, he is <i>“receiving the grace of God in vain”</i> (2 Corinthians 6:1), presuming that grace means he can safely dabble in sin a little longer. What he fails to realize is that every indulgence hardens his heart and makes repentance more difficult. He is racing toward a spiritual crisis: unless he wakes up and <i>“puts to death the deeds of the body”</i> (Romans 8:13), his <b>faith will die</b>. Though he calls Jesus “Lord,” if he will not obey, he will not enter the Kingdom (cf. Matthew 7:21).
