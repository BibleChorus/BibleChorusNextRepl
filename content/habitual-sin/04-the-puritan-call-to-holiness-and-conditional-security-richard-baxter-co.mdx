Moving forward over a millennium to the 17th century, we encounter the **Puritans** – English Reformed pastors and theologians known for their deep concern for practical godliness and the eternal state of souls. The Puritans, while holding Reformation doctrines of grace, were pastorally very wary of *antinomianism* (the abuse of grace as an excuse for sin). They emphasized what they often called **“conditional salvation”** or **“conditional justification.”** By this, they did not mean that we earn our salvation, but that the **covenant of grace has conditions** (namely, repentant faith and its fruits), and that *only those believers who fulfill these conditions (by God’s grace) will finally be saved*. In simpler terms, they taught that **continuing in obedient faith is necessary for final salvation**, and conversely that a *professor of faith who lives in unrepentant sin has no grounds to consider himself justified*. In this chapter, we will focus especially on **Richard Baxter** – a leading Puritan divine – and his explicit teachings on the necessity of persevering holiness. Baxter wrote *The Saints’ Everlasting Rest* and *Aphorisms of Justification*, among many other works, dealing precisely with these issues. We will see that Baxter, echoing the early church, insists that a Christian’s hope of heaven is **inseparable from a life of mortification of sin and growth in righteousness**. We will also draw supporting insights from **John Owen**, **Thomas Watson**, and **John Flavel**, other prominent Puritans, to reinforce that this was the common Puritan understanding: **true justifying faith is a fighting, enduring faith that actively *“works by love”* and produces holiness – without which no one will see the Lord**.

It is important to note that many Puritans (especially in the Calvinist tradition) believed in the *eternal security of the elect*, but they simultaneously believed that **God preserves His elect by inclining their wills to holiness and repentance**. Therefore, from the human perspective, they preached that *if one does not persevere in obedience, one proves not to be elect*. In practice, their preaching sounded very much like conditional security, urging believers to make their calling and election sure by diligent holiness (2 Pet 1:10). They did not coddle anyone in sinful complacency by saying *“once saved always saved”*; instead, they would say with the apostle Peter, *“only the one who overcomes and continues in the faith will finally be saved”*. As we shall see, **Richard Baxter in particular was even accused of being too “conditional” in his view of justification**, because he stressed the necessity of continued obedience so strongly. But Baxter’s aim was deeply pastoral: to *wake up the lukewarm and the hypocrite*, and to spur true believers on to greater assurance through holiness. Let us first delve into Baxter’s thought.
