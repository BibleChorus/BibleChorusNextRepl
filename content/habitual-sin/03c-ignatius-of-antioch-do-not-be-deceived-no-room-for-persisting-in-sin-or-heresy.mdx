Moving into the early 2nd century, we consider **Ignatius of Antioch** (died c. 107 AD). Ignatius was a bishop who wrote several letters to churches on his way to martyrdom. In them, he passionately urges believers to **cling to Christ, unity, and sound doctrine** – and he *denounces false teachers and immoral influences*. In his epistle to the **Ephesians**, Ignatius echoes Paul’s warning almost verbatim and even extends it. He writes:

*“Do not err, my brethren. … Those that corrupt families shall not inherit the kingdom of God[<sup>newadvent.org</sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0104.htm#:~:text=Do%20not%20err%20%2C%20my,one%20that%20hearkens%20unto%20him). If, then, those who do this as respects the flesh have suffered death, how much more shall this be the case with anyone who corrupts by wicked doctrine the faith of God… Such a one, becoming defiled, shall go away into everlasting fire, and so shall everyone that hearkens unto him.”[<sup>newadvent.org</sup>*](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0104.htm#:~:text=Do%20not%20err%20%2C%20my,one%20that%20hearkens%20unto%20him)*

Ignatius first quotes what appears to be a known saying (likely based on 1 Cor 6:9–10): <i>“Those that corrupt families shall not inherit the kingdom”[<sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0104.htm#:~:text=Do%20not%20err%20%2C%20my,one%20that%20hearkens%20unto%20him)</i>. This phrase <i>“corrupt families”</i> probably refers to sexual immorality (some translate it “adulterers”). It’s essentially listing a class of sinners who will be excluded from God’s kingdom. Ignatius takes that accepted truth – that an immoral person (one breaking up families, perhaps through adultery or sexual sin) <b>will not inherit heaven</b> – and then makes a <b>fortiori</b> argument: if <i>that</i> is true in the realm of immoral behavior, <b>“how much more”</b> will a person who corrupts others with heretical teaching be damned. <i>Such a one</i>, Ignatius says, <i>goes to everlasting fire[<sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0104.htm#:~:text=then%2C%20those%20who%20do%20this,away%20into%20everlasting%20fire%2C%20and)</i>. And not only the false teacher, but <i>“everyone that hearkens to him”</i> – i.e., those led into apostasy by listening to false doctrine. Notice, he puts <b>persistent sexual sin and persistent doctrinal apostasy</b> in a similar category: both lead to exclusion from the kingdom and eternal fire. He also uses <i>“Do not err”</i> (same as “do not be deceived”) to preface this warning[<i><sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0104.htm#:~:text=Do%20not%20err%20%2C%20my,one%20that%20hearkens%20unto%20him), showing that he, like Paul and John, worries that believers might be fooled into thinking differently. Ignatius evidently wants the Ephesians to grasp that <b>Christian profession means nothing if one becomes an adulterer or a promoter of falsehood – the end is hell</b>.

In another letter, to the <b>Philadelphians</b>, Ignatius similarly warns against schismatics and those who depart from the bishop. He says: <i>“If anyone follows him that makes a schism, <b>he shall not inherit the kingdom of God</b>”[<sup>biblehub.com</sup></i>](https://biblehub.com/library/ignatius/the_epistle_of_ignatius_to_the_philadelphians/chapter_iii_avoid_schismatics.htm#:~:text=Avoid%20Schismatics.%20,893%5D%20opinion%2C%20he)</i>. Again, we hear the echo of Paul’s “will not inherit” warning, applied here to divisive persons. Ignatius is consistent: <b>certain behaviors put one outside salvation’s path</b> – whether sexual sin, divisiveness, or doctrinal deviance. Faith in Christ, to Ignatius, cannot be separated from <b>submission to Christ’s truth and love in the community</b>. Those who abandon that for sin or error are no longer on track to the kingdom.

Ignatius also stresses **obedience**. He tells the **Trallians**: *“**Be not deceived**… no one professing faith sins; nor does anyone possessing love hate his brother”* (Trallians 6). And to the **Magnesians** he writes, *“**It is absurd to profess Christ Jesus, and to practice Judaism**”* (Magnesians 10) – meaning one’s behavior must match one’s confession. The consistent message: *Don’t kid yourself.* If someone *“professes faith”* yet “sins” (by which he means lives in sin), he’s deceived. If someone claims to love God but hates others, he’s lying. Ignatius clearly saw **moral and practical proof** as essential to genuine Christianity.

So in Ignatius, just a decade or so after the apostle John’s death, we see the same line drawn: <b>persisting in sin or heresy leads to damnation, regardless of one’s claim to Christianity</b>. Far from giving people an unconditional security, Ignatius urges them to <i>persevere in unity, sound doctrine, and holiness.</i> He even says in one place: <i>“For this cause did the Lord suffer the ointment to be poured on His head, that He might breathe immortality into His Church. <b>Be not anointed with the ill odor of the prince of this world</b>”</i> (Eph. 17) – a poetic way to say: Christ gave us the fragrance of life; don’t let Satan’s foul odor (sin, lies) stain you. <i>“Why do we foolishly perish,”</i> he asks, <i>“not recognizing the gift of God?”[<sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0104.htm#:~:text=Chapter%2017,doctrines)</i>. In Ignatius’s view, a Christian who turns to the world’s lies is <i>foolishly perishing</i> – throwing away the gift of salvation. This is a powerful witness that the early sub-apostolic church saw <b>salvation as conditional upon persevering in truth and love</b>.
