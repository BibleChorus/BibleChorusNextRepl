What is at stake with this modern diminution? **Souls are at stake.** If Scripture is to be believed, there are people now in our churches who, barring repentance, **“must expect the lake of fire”** (Rev. 21:8) despite their profession of faith. But because they have been given continual assurances and scant warnings, they continue comfortably in sin, **mistaking God’s patience for license**. The cost is both individual and corporate:

- **Individual danger:** A man addicted to pornography in a church that never warns of hell for such behavior may never come to godly sorrow. He may compare himself to others (“everyone struggles”) and wait for sanctification to “happen” without drastic action. If he never breaks free and dies in unrepentance, the Bible’s sober verdict is that he will not inherit the Kingdom (1 Cor. 6:9–10). How tragic if he goes to judgment saying, “But I was told I was saved…” The very phrase “do not be deceived” (used by Paul regarding these sins) implies the possibility of tragic self-deception. **The church that fails to warn has, in effect, not loved this man’s soul.**
- **Corporate impurity:** When warnings diminish, **sin flourishes in the church’s midst**, weakening its witness and grieving the Holy Spirit. Churches become numerically large but spiritually anemic—*“having a form of godliness but denying its power”* (2 Tim. 3:5). Sexual scandals among clergy, ethical failures, and the rampant secret sins of members all thrive in an environment where **the fear of God is absent**. Early Christians were known for their striking purity in a decadent world; many modern churches are almost indistinguishable from the world in conduct. This diminishes the glory of Christ’s church before unbelievers.
- **False assurance:** Perhaps the greatest cost is that **false assurance replaces true assurance.** True assurance is based on *both* the promise of God and the evidence of a transformed life. Diminished warnings sever the second component. People cling to a promise divorced from its moral context. John’s epistle gives tests (e.g. “we know that we have come to know Him if we keep His commandments” – 1 John 2:3). Remove those tests, and you get nominal Christians feeling very secure, while truly devout souls (who might need comfort) sometimes unnecessarily doubt because all the warnings they *do* see in Scripture are being explained away by others. It’s an ironic twist: **those who shouldn’t feel safe, do; and those who strive for holiness, fearing the Lord, often get little encouragement** because the church at large is awkward about the whole topic of assurance and holy fear.

The **moral and spiritual anemia** of the Western church today can be traced, in part, to this imbalance. We preach *half* the truth (grace, love, security) but not the *other half* (holiness, fear, conditional warnings). But half-truths can behave like lies in practice. Jesus and the apostles did not shy from putting conditions and warnings next to promises. *“If by the Spirit you are putting to death the deeds of the body, you will live”* (Rom. 8:13) — which logically implies if you *aren’t*, you will die. Such clarity jolts the soul into action. If that clarity is consistently missing from our pulpits, **we inadvertently encourage spiritual laziness and compromise.**

As a result, many professing believers today live in a tragic state that one author called **“unsaved Christians”** – people who think themselves Christians but are not regenerate or are on the road of apostasy. They may **“name the name of Christ,” but depart not from iniquity”** (cf. 2 Tim. 2:19). They believe they’re headed for heaven, even as they march toward hell. And the church’s silence or softness confirms them in that delusion. This should break our hearts and spur us to recover the full counsel of God.
