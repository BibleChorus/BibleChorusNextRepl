**Abstract:** Having established the peril of continued sin for believers, this chapter issues a direct and pastoral **call to repentance coupled with genuine hope.** It begins by unpacking Romans 6 and Titus 2:11–14 (NASB) to show that God’s grace not only saves but also empowers believers to **die to sin and live righteously**. The message is sober: anyone **practicing sins like pornography or other sexual immorality must expect the lake of fire unless they thoroughly repent and are delivered**. Yet alongside this warning, the chapter emphasizes that **immediate and complete repentance, enabled by God’s power, can restore the worst sinner**. True repentance is described in practical terms—renouncing sin, confessing openly, and pursuing holiness with endurance to the end. Drawing on the model of the early church, the chapter avoids modern therapeutic counsel and instead encourages classical spiritual disciplines of self-examination, fasting, and accountability within the community. It also provides concrete aids: a suggested liturgy of repentance (with prayers and Scripture readings) that individuals or congregations can use, and reflection questions for personal application. The tone remains both **academic and devotional**—grounded in Scripture and theological truth, yet warm and encouraging, assuring readers that **no one who genuinely turns from sin to God will be cast out.** In a world of compromise, this chapter aims to rekindle a holy urgency and a joyful hope in the soul that responds to God’s call: **“Repent… and live!”**
