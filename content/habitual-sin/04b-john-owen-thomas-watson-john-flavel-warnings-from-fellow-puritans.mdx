Let’s briefly bring in a few supporting quotes from Baxter’s contemporaries to show this was not an idiosyncratic view:

<b>John Owen (1616–1683)</b>, known for his treatise <i>The Mortification of Sin</i>, famously exhorted believers: <i>“Do you mortify; do you make it your daily work? Be always at it while you live; cease not a day from this work; <b>be killing sin or it will be killing you</b>.”[<sup>goodreads.com</sup></i>](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/963394-mortification-of-sin-in-believers-the-necessity-nature-and-means-of-it#:~:text=Like)</i> This succinctly captures the Puritan urgency: if you don’t actively put your sin to death, it will take your life (spiritually and perhaps even physically). Sin isn’t neutral; <i>unmortified sin will, in Owen’s words, “darken the soul and destroy its peace... and if it gets strength, it will utterly harden”</i> (Mortification, ch. 2). Owen did believe in the perseverance of the truly regenerate, but as a means God uses, He puts this duty of mortification on the believer. He warned that <b>allowing the flesh to rule unchallenged is soul-killing</b>. This aligns exactly with Romans 8:13, which Owen expounded: <i>“If you live after the flesh, <b>you shall die</b>; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, <b>you shall live</b>.”</i> The implication for a porn-addicted person is clear in Owen: If you do not go to war against that lust, it <i>will</i> be killing you – it will choke your soul, perhaps even to apostasy. But if by the Spirit’s power you continually slay it, you will live. Owen would not have comforted someone in such sin with “don’t worry about your salvation”; he would have said, <i>“Repent and fight, or you will perish.”</i>

<b>Thomas Watson (1620–1686)</b>, another beloved Puritan, in his <i>Doctrine of Repentance</i> wrote an incisive warning: <i>“It is not falling into water that drowns, but <b>lying in it</b>. It is not falling into sin that damns, but <b>lying in it without repentance</b>.”[<sup>jamesmirror.com](https://jamesmirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/highlights-from-the-doctrine-of-repentance.pdf#:~:text=love%3F%20As%20God%20has%20two,results%20at%20last%20in%20the)[jamesmirror.com</i></sup>](https://jamesmirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/highlights-from-the-doctrine-of-repentance.pdf#:~:text=places%20he%20dells%20in%2C%20hell,Hardness%20of%20heart%20results%20at)</i>. Watson thus distinguished between the Christian who might fall into a sin but then gets out of it (repents), versus one who <i>“lies in it”</i> (continues, no repentance). The latter, he says bluntly, <b>will be damned[<i><sup>jamesmirror.com](https://jamesmirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/highlights-from-the-doctrine-of-repentance.pdf#:~:text=love%3F%20As%20God%20has%20two,results%20at%20last%20in%20the)[jamesmirror.com</i></sup>](https://jamesmirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/highlights-from-the-doctrine-of-repentance.pdf#:~:text=places%20he%20dells%20in%2C%20hell,Hardness%20of%20heart%20results%20at)</b>. This quote directly supports our theme: a true believer may stumble, but he cannot settle in sin; if someone does settle in sin, it shows he’s headed for damnation unless he’s jolted into repentance. Watson also said, <i>“<b>Till sin be bitter, Christ will not be sweet</b>.”</i> He meant that one who excuses or cherishes sin has not truly savored Christ by faith. The implication for those coddling a “pet sin” is that they likely have not truly embraced Christ, or at least are not currently in a position of enjoying His saving sweetness. Watson’s many sermons also echo the refrain that one sin lived in, loved and not fought, is enough to damn the soul (because it reveals an unrenewed heart). He wrote, <i>“A godly man may fall into sin, but he is soon out; whereas the wicked lie wallowing in sin”</i>. So the Puritans drew a sharp line: <b>The godly fight and rise from sin; the hypocrites wallow in it</b>. Thus if you find yourself “wallowing,” you have no right to think you’re saved.

<b>John Flavel (1627–1691)</b> likewise admonished that <i>“No man can scripturally expect heaven without holiness”</i>, as we saw in his Q&A[<i><sup>puritanboard.com</sup></i>](https://puritanboard.com/threads/john-flavel-no-holiness-no-heaven.100420/#:~:text=Q,not%20glorify%20him%20on%20earth). He also preached on self-deception. In one discourse he said: <i>“They that sow to their flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption [Gal 6:8]; and do you think God will save you, when you will not be saved from your sins? What ground hath any man to think he shall go to heaven, whose life is earthly, who ‘minds earthly things’ (Phil 3:19)? No more than a swine to think it shall go to a feast, because it’s fed in a fair meadow. <b>No, no; if you live after the flesh, you shall die.</b>”</i> Here Flavel appeals to common sense: how can someone living carnally in love with the world think he’s prepared for heaven? He cannot; Scripture opposes it. The swine metaphor is striking – one may enjoy some earthly providences (the fair meadow), but if one is swinish in nature, one is fit for slaughter, not feasting – an allusion to judgment. And he again quotes Romans 8:13’s warning of death[<i><sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210219.htm#:~:text=And%20he%20does%20not%20say%2C,faith%2C%20will%20be%20cut%20off).

In sum, the **Puritans** vigorously affirmed exactly what we are contending: **Continued pornography use (as one example of enslaving sin) is utterly inconsistent with a state of grace**, and unless it is repented of and mortified, it will drag the soul to hell. They held that a true Christian may fall into that snare, but he will – by God’s grace – be brought to repentance, fight it, and not “lie in it.” If someone continues on impenitently, the Puritans would counsel that person to consider himself unsaved and fly to Christ for true deliverance and pardon. They wouldn’t lull him with unconditional eternal security talk; they’d press the *conditions of the covenant* on him – *“Repent and believe in a living way!”*

Richard Baxter’s **“Saints’ Rest”** has a memorable summation addressing the reader’s conscience: *“Thus, reader, I have given thee some brief directions; if thou canst not by these be brought to value and seek after this rest [in heaven], I am afraid thy case is dangerous. If thou be a Christian indeed, thou wilt see more reason to obey than I can shew thee… **I charge thee, from the living God, that thou do not wilfully neglect thy soul!**”* Baxter pleads and charges the reader to take action – *do not neglect your soul*. This resonates with our own plea: **If you continue to neglect these warnings and cling to your lust, you are willfully neglecting your soul – and we charge you before God to stop and consider.** The path you’re on ends in the lake of fire. But today, there is yet a path of return through repentance, faith, and the sanctifying grace of Christ.

Let us close this chapter with Baxter’s own words of encouragement to those who <i>do</i> turn and persevere. In <i>Saints’ Rest</i>, after many warnings, he lifts the penitent’s eyes to Christ: <i>“Oh, how unworthily do most men think of Christ, that they will not part with a lust, or a little pleasure or profit, or ease, for Him! That they dare not trust Him for their salvation! ... <b>But those who have truly received Christ have thereby broken their league with sin and fully engaged their hearts to Him.</b></i>”[<i><sup>ebooks.regent-college.edu](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/130/#:~:text=1R%20128%20OUR%20TITLE%20TO,lay%20down%20to%20be%20inquired)[ebooks.regent-college.edu</i></sup>](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/130/#:~:text=give%20thee%20leave%2C%20thou%20hadst,of%20salvation%2C%20nor%20whether%20thou) Here Baxter notes that many <i>refuse</i> to give up lust or ease for Christ – showing they value that more. But the true receiver of Christ <i>breaks league with sin</i>. If you truly come to Christ, you <i>must and will</i> break your covenant with your lust and engage your heart to Christ as Lord. Baxter continues, <i>“They <b>are not of Christ’s religion who have not parted with their sins, and changed the stream of their affections</b>, and made Him their highest desire and delight.”</i> This is essentially the Puritan definition of a <i>real Christian</i>. If that’s not you, the Puritans would say: do not rest till it is.

The collective testimony of these faithful men of old agrees with Scripture and the early church: **Only those who *by grace* conquer their sins (instead of being conquered by them) will inherit the everlasting rest.** Those who choose to remain *friends of sin* show themselves *enemies of God* and will share the devil’s torment. Therefore, heed this warning and **embrace the grace of God which not only freely forgives but also teaches us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts** (Titus 2:11–12). The same Christ who died to atone for our sins *also* rose again to pour out His Spirit and *“turn every one of you from your wicked ways”* (Acts 3:26). Puritan theology harmonizes with the apostolic: *Jesus is a perfect Savior, able to save to the uttermost those who come to God by Him (Heb 7:25) – but coming to God by Him includes leaving your idols and submitting to Him as Lord. Grace is free, but it is not cheap; it calls for **total allegiance**.*

In conclusion, we have now heard from Scripture, the early church, and the Puritans a unified message. The next and final step is to apply it personally: <i>“Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith”</i> (2 Cor 13:5). Dear reader, if you name the name of Christ yet continue in pornography or any willful sin, these pages have made the danger abundantly clear. <b>You cannot serve two masters</b>. Will you obey the voice of God’s Word and Spirit, <b>“Come out from among them and be separate… and I will receive you”</b> (2 Cor 6:17)? Or will you harden your heart and presume on grace, thereby treasuring up wrath for yourself? The promise and the warning are before you: <i>“If we confess and forsake our sins, we shall have mercy”[<sup>jamesmirror.com](https://jamesmirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/highlights-from-the-doctrine-of-repentance.pdf#:~:text=love%3F%20As%20God%20has%20two,results%20at%20last%20in%20the)[jamesmirror.com</i></sup>](https://jamesmirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/highlights-from-the-doctrine-of-repentance.pdf#:~:text=places%20he%20dells%20in%2C%20hell,Hardness%20of%20heart%20results%20at)</i> – but <i>“if we go on sinning willfully… there remains no sacrifice, only a fearful expectation of judgment”</i> (Heb 10:26–27).

Our prayer is that you will choose the fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom (Prov 9:10), and through that fear be driven to <b>true repentance</b>. For <i>“surely His salvation is near to those who fear Him”</i> (Ps 85:9). Forsake the deception of pornography; it promises pleasure but pays with death. <b>Embrace the Savior, Jesus Christ</b>, who promises <i>“freedom indeed”</i> (John 8:36) and <i>“eternal life to those who by patient continuance in doing good seek glory, honor, and immortality”[<sup>ebooks.regent-college.edu](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/131/#:~:text=Chap,man%20knoweth%2C%20saving%20he%20that)[ebooks.regent-college.edu</i></sup>](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/131/#:~:text=important%2C%20that%20he%20who%20performeth,upon%20him%20the%20name%20of)</i>. Do not rest until you can say with a sincere heart what Richard Baxter and all true saints have said: <i>“I take God in Christ for my only rest, and <b>I will value no treasure or pleasure that would keep me from Him.</b>”[<sup>christiansoldiers.co.za](https://www.christiansoldiers.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/The_saints_everlasting_rest_quotes.pdf#:~:text=Quotes%20from%20The%20saints%20everlasting,May%20the%20living%20God)[christiansoldiers.co.za</i></sup>](https://www.christiansoldiers.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/The_saints_everlasting_rest_quotes.pdf#:~:text=2%20www,May%20the%20living%20God)</i> Then, and only then, you may have the solid assurance that <b>“Saints shall indeed have an everlasting rest”</b>.
