# Chapter 3A: Early Church Witness - 1st Century Voices

How did the earliest Christians – those closest in time to the apostles – understand the relationship between *baptism, post-conversion sin, and salvation*? Did they teach *"once saved, always saved"* regardless of one's lifestyle? Did they minimize the threat of **apostasy** (falling away) for believers? 

The historical record is clear: the early church overwhelmingly believed that **after baptism, a believer must continue in holiness, and that serious sin could indeed put one's salvation in jeopardy**. They stressed **vigilance and repentance**, warning that those who **turn back to a life of sin face damnation** unless they repent.

In this chapter, we examine two foundational 1st-century Christian writings: *the Didache* and *1 Clement*. Despite their different contexts, both echo the New Testament in insisting that **nominal Christians living in sin will not be saved**. This historical witness should challenge the modern church to recover a **healthy fear of God** and an emphasis on *perseverance in righteousness*.

## The Didache – Two Ways: Life or Death, Holiness or Destruction

One of the earliest Christian documents after the New Testament is the **Didache** (late 1st century, also called "The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles"). It served as a sort of church manual for early Christian communities. The Didache opens with a memorable description of **two ways**: the way of life and the way of death. It leaves no doubt that **sinful conduct leads to damnation, whereas obedience leads to life**:

"There are two ways, one of life and one of death; but a great difference between the two ways... The way of life ... is this: First, you shall love God who made you; second, love your neighbor as yourself... And the second commandment of the Teaching; You shall not commit murder, you shall not commit adultery... you shall not commit fornication, you shall not steal... you shall not practice magic, you shall not practice witchcraft... you shall not covet... My child, flee from every evil thing, and from every likeness of it..."<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="ref-1">[1]</a></sup>

After enumerating many sins to avoid (including sexual sins, occult practices, and attitudes like double-mindedness and pride), the Didache then describes:

"The way of death is this: First of all it is evil and full of curse: murders, adulteries, lusts, fornications, thefts, idolatries... deceit, haughtiness... [those who do these things are] utter sinners. Be delivered, children, from all these."<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="ref-2">[2]</a></sup>

The stark contrast is evident. The *"way of life"* involves **obeying God's commandments**, practicing love and purity. The *"way of death"* is characterized by the very sins listed. And the readers ("children") are urged to **keep free** from all those vices. The Didache doesn't explicitly use the terms *heaven* and *hell* here, but *"way of death"* clearly implies **final destruction**. If one walks in those sins, one is on the road to **death** (spiritual death and exclusion from life).

The implication is that **baptized Christians must continue living by the way of life**. In fact, later the Didache instructs that before baptism, the catechumens must learn all these commands and commit to following *"the yoke of the Lord"* (Didache 6). It even says, *"If you are able to bear the entire yoke of the Lord, you will be perfect; but if you are not able, do what you can"*<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="ref-3">[3]</a></sup> – indicating that strenuous obedience is expected, even if one grows into full maturity over time.

What's crucial is that the earliest post-New Testament writing presents the Christian life in **binary terms**: either you pursue the path of holiness (leading to eternal life), or you follow sin (leading to death). There is no third category of "carnal Christian who will still slide into heaven." If some modern teachers imply that one can live like those on the "way of death" yet still have eternal life because of a one-time decision, the **Didache's authors would vehemently disagree**. They inherited from the apostles the understanding that **continuance in gross sin is a soul-destroying path**. *"Be delivered... from all these,"* they plead.

## Clement of Rome – "Abandon Evil Desires that We May Be Sheltered from Judgments"

Moving to the late 1st century, we have a letter known as **1 Clement**, traditionally ascribed to *Clement of Rome* (c. AD 96), written to the Corinthian church. Clement was concerned with a schism in Corinth, but along the way, he exhorts the believers to **repent of envy and strife** and pursue humility and obedience. Clement clearly believes that **fearing God and maintaining good works are necessary to avoid God's judgment**. For example:

"Since, therefore, all things are seen and heard by Him, let us fear Him and abandon the filthy desires for evil deeds, that we may be sheltered by His mercy from the judgments to come."<sup><a href="#footnote-4" id="ref-4">[4]</a></sup>

Here Clement urges the church to *fear God*, turn away from any *"filthy desires"* and sinful deeds, precisely so that they may obtain mercy and not condemnation in the coming Judgment. This echoes the New Testament call to *cleanse ourselves from defilement out of fear of God* (<BibleVerse reference="2 Corinthians 7:1" />). Clement doesn't take it for granted that all in the church will automatically escape judgment; rather, **they must persevere in holiness to find mercy**.

Clement also emphasizes that being God's people entails **living up to that calling**. He reminds them:

"Let us, therefore, approach Him with holiness of spirit, lifting unto Him pure and undefiled hands... Since, therefore, we are a portion of the Holy One, let us do all such things as pertain to holiness, avoiding evil-speaking, foul and impure embraces, drunkenness, disorderliness, abominable desires, detestable adultery... justified by our deeds, and not by our words."<sup><a href="#footnote-5" id="ref-5">[5]</a></sup>

Observe several things in this exhortation. Clement bases ethical living on identity: *"we are a portion of the Holy One"* (God's people), therefore we must *"do all things that pertain to holiness."* He then explicitly lists *avoiding* things like foul embraces (likely sexual sin), **drunkenness**, **lust ("abominable desires"), and adultery**, among others. If members of the church were engaging in any of those, Clement's instruction is to **stop** – holiness admits no such practices.

Strikingly, he says we are *"justified by our deeds, and not by our words."* This is not a denial of justification by faith; rather, in context, Clement means that our **true righteousness is demonstrated in actions, not in mere talk**<sup><a href="#footnote-6" id="ref-6">[6]</a></sup>. It's akin to James saying *"I will show you my faith by my works"* (<BibleVerse reference="James 2:18" />). Many might *claim* to be righteous, but Clement reminds them that **God's verdict in the end will accord with how we actually lived**. If our *deeds* are wicked, no mere *words* or affiliations will save us.

The letter frequently calls for **repentance** and a return to peace, humility, and obedience so that they may all the more *"partake in God's promises."* Clearly, Clement does not teach an unconditional security where behavior is irrelevant. Rather, he exhorts to *"clothe ourselves in concord, being humble and self-controlled... living in the fear of God"* – because only in this way will they remain in God's favor.

## Conclusion: The Foundation is Set

From this survey of the late 1st century, we see the **foundation** being laid by the earliest post-apostolic Christian leaders: **baptized believers must persevere in holiness, and those who turn back to a life of sin face eternal condemnation unless they urgently repent**. The Didache presents stark alternatives of life and death based on one's way of living. Clement of Rome warns that Christians must fear God and abandon evil desires to be sheltered from coming judgment.

Neither taught that a Christian could live in ongoing, unrepentant sin and still be assured of salvation. On the contrary, they explicitly warned that such a lifestyle leads to **exclusion from God's kingdom**. They affirmed both God's mercy for the truly penitent and His judgment on the persistently rebellious – even among the baptized.

This historical witness stands as a powerful challenge to modern notions of "cheap grace" or "carnal Christianity." The early church's message to someone trapped in habitual sin would be urgent and clear: *"You are on the way of death. Do not be deceived. Repent immediately and turn from this sin, or you will perish."*

In our next chapter, we will see how this same sobering message continued in the 2nd century through the voices of Ignatius of Antioch and The Shepherd of Hermas, who faced their own challenges as the church grew and spiritual dangers multiplied.
