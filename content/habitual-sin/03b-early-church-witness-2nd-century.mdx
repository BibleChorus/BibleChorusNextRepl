# Chapter 3B: Early Church Witness - 2nd Century Voices

Moving into the early 2nd century, the church faced new challenges as it grew and spread throughout the Roman Empire. Questions arose about post-baptismal sin, the possibility of restoration after apostasy, and the requirements for authentic Christian living. Two significant voices from this period continue the sobering message we heard from the 1st century: **Christians who persist in serious sin face eternal condemnation unless they genuinely repent**.

In this chapter, we examine **Ignatius of Antioch**, the martyr-bishop who wrote letters on his way to execution, and **The Shepherd of Hermas**, an allegorical work that urgently warned about the limited time for repentance. Both writers insisted that **salvation requires perseverance in holiness** and that those who make peace with sin forfeit their hope of eternal life.

## Ignatius of Antioch – "Do Not Be Deceived": No Room for Persisting in Sin or Heresy

**Ignatius of Antioch** (died c. 107 AD) was a bishop who wrote several letters to churches on his way to martyrdom. In them, he passionately urges believers to **cling to Christ, unity, and sound doctrine** – and he *denounces false teachers and immoral influences*. In his epistle to the **Ephesians**, Ignatius echoes Paul's warning almost verbatim and even extends it. He writes:

"Do not err, my brethren. ... Those that corrupt families shall not inherit the kingdom of God. If, then, those who do this as respects the flesh have suffered death, how much more shall this be the case with anyone who corrupts by wicked doctrine the faith of God... Such a one, becoming defiled, shall go away into everlasting fire, and so shall everyone that hearkens unto him."<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="ref-1">[1]</a></sup>

Ignatius first quotes what appears to be a known saying (likely based on <BibleVerse reference="1 Corinthians 6:9-10" />): *"Those that corrupt families shall not inherit the kingdom"*<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="ref-2">[2]</a></sup>. This phrase *"corrupt families"* probably refers to sexual immorality (some translate it "adulterers"). It's essentially listing a class of sinners who will be excluded from God's kingdom. Ignatius takes that accepted truth – that an immoral person (one breaking up families, perhaps through adultery or sexual sin) **will not inherit heaven** – and then makes a **fortiori** argument: if *that* is true in the realm of immoral behavior, **"how much more"** will a person who corrupts others with heretical teaching be damned. *Such a one*, Ignatius says, *goes to everlasting fire*<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="ref-3">[3]</a></sup>. And not only the false teacher, but *"everyone that hearkens to him"* – i.e., those led into apostasy by listening to false doctrine.

Notice, he puts **persistent sexual sin and persistent doctrinal apostasy** in a similar category: both lead to exclusion from the kingdom and eternal fire. He also uses *"Do not err"* (same as "do not be deceived") to preface this warning<sup><a href="#footnote-4" id="ref-4">[4]</a></sup>, showing that he, like Paul and John, worries that believers might be fooled into thinking differently. Ignatius evidently wants the Ephesians to grasp that **Christian profession means nothing if one becomes an adulterer or a promoter of falsehood – the end is hell**.

In another letter, to the **Philadelphians**, Ignatius similarly warns against schismatics and those who depart from the bishop. He says: *"If anyone follows him that makes a schism, **he shall not inherit the kingdom of God**"*<sup><a href="#footnote-5" id="ref-5">[5]</a></sup>. Again, we hear the echo of Paul's "will not inherit" warning, applied here to divisive persons. Ignatius is consistent: **certain behaviors put one outside salvation's path** – whether sexual sin, divisiveness, or doctrinal deviance. Faith in Christ, to Ignatius, cannot be separated from **submission to Christ's truth and love in the community**. Those who abandon that for sin or error are no longer on track to the kingdom.

Ignatius also stresses **obedience**. He tells the **Trallians**: *"**Be not deceived**... no one professing faith sins; nor does anyone possessing love hate his brother"* (Trallians 6). And to the **Magnesians** he writes, *"**It is absurd to profess Christ Jesus, and to practice Judaism**"* (Magnesians 10) – meaning one's behavior must match one's confession. The consistent message: *Don't kid yourself.* If someone *"professes faith"* yet "sins" (by which he means lives in sin), he's deceived. If someone claims to love God but hates others, he's lying. Ignatius clearly saw **moral and practical proof** as essential to genuine Christianity.

So in Ignatius, just a decade or so after the apostle John's death, we see the same line drawn: **persisting in sin or heresy leads to damnation, regardless of one's claim to Christianity**. Far from giving people an unconditional security, Ignatius urges them to *persevere in unity, sound doctrine, and holiness.* He even says in one place: *"For this cause did the Lord suffer the ointment to be poured on His head, that He might breathe immortality into His Church. **Be not anointed with the ill odor of the prince of this world**"* (Eph. 17) – a poetic way to say: Christ gave us the fragrance of life; don't let Satan's foul odor (sin, lies) stain you. *"Why do we foolishly perish,"* he asks, *"not recognizing the gift of God?"*<sup><a href="#footnote-6" id="ref-6">[6]</a></sup>. In Ignatius's view, a Christian who turns to the world's lies is *foolishly perishing* – throwing away the gift of salvation.

## The Shepherd of Hermas – Limited Second Repentance and the Peril of Post-Baptismal Sin

One of the most illuminating early texts on this subject is **The Shepherd of Hermas** (mid-2nd century). *Hermas* is an allegorical work recording visions and teachings given to a man named Hermas. Its central concern is the **moral purity of Christians and the possibility of repentance after sin**. Hermas reflects the struggle of the early church to balance God's mercy with the seriousness of sin *after baptism*. At times, Hermas was so strict that later Christians debated its meaning. But one passage stands out for its **urgency about not delaying repentance**:

"The Lord has sworn by His glory, in regard to His elect, that if any one of them sin after a certain day which has been fixed, he shall not be saved. For the repentance of the righteous has limits. Filled up are the days of repentance to all the saints; but to the heathen, repentance will be possible even to the last day."<sup><a href="#footnote-7" id="ref-7">[7]</a></sup>

This is an astonishing statement. Hermas claims a revelation that God set a *deadline* for His people to repent. Essentially, he's saying: *God gave the Church a limited time window ("a certain day") by which the elect needed to turn from sins; beyond that, any who continue sinning will not be saved.* He explicitly says *"the repentance of the righteous has limits,"* and that for Christians (*"saints"*) the allotted days of repentance have been completed<sup><a href="#footnote-8" id="ref-8">[8]</a></sup>. In contrast, non-Christians ("heathen") still have until the final judgment to find repentance (presumably through conversion).

Scholars interpret this in context of a crisis in the early church: many believers had fallen into grave sins (like denying Christ under persecution, or sexual immorality), and the church wrestled with whether to readmit them if they repent. Hermas seems to indicate that **God in His mercy allowed one single post-baptismal repentance** – a sort of extraordinary grace period – but warns that believers must not presume they can sin with impunity repeatedly. *"If any one of them sins after [that fixed day], he shall not be saved."*<sup><a href="#footnote-9" id="ref-9">[9]</a></sup> This suggests that **continued willful sin can exhaust one's opportunity to repent**. Hermas pictures a scenario where **grace's door can shut** on a Christian who keeps abusing it.

The theology here is admittedly peculiar (later Church would allow that sincere repentance is always possible if one lives). But the thrust is clear: **Don't delay repentance, and don't assume you can always come back later.** There may come a time when **repentance is no longer granted** to the hardhearted. This aligns with <BibleVerse reference="Hebrews 6:4-6" />: *"it is impossible to renew them again to repentance"* if they fall away.

Hermas repeatedly urges righteousness. In Vision 3, he sees a tower being built (symbolizing the Church), and some stones are rejected due to sins; he's told they can be purified if they repent quickly, but if not, they may not enter the tower. At one point, Hermas asks if certain grievous sins of believers can be forgiven, and the angel (the Shepherd) essentially says *yes, if done once; but continual betrayal of God is deadly.* The Shepherd says: *"You have sinned greatly, yet not for your own sake only was this allowed, but that you might admonish others not to do wickedly... But if, after this, you sin and are not converted... you shall be punished."* Hermas thus advocates **one time of post-conversion repentance** – after that, one who **returns to sin is in peril of damnation**.

Even if one doesn't accept Hermas' idea of a fixed deadline in a literal sense, the **pastoral warning is profound**: *The righteous cannot assume indefinite time to repent.* God may withdraw the grace of repentance if we persistently spurn it. Therefore, Hermas urges believers to **stop procrastinating and purify their lives immediately**. He vividly describes believers who *"add to their sins and walk in lusts"* as "defiling the name of the Lord" – those individuals, he warns, will **lose salvation if they do not cease**<sup><a href="#footnote-10" id="ref-10">[10]</a></sup>.

In modern terms, Hermas would absolutely reject the notion of a habitual porn-user casually saying, *"Well, I'll repent later; God will always take me back."* Hermas would thunder: *"The repentance of the righteous has limits!"*<sup><a href="#footnote-11" id="ref-11">[11]</a></sup>. There may *come a point* where later never comes. So again: **Repent now and utterly, or risk being lost.**

## Conclusion: The 2nd Century Warning Intensifies

From this survey of the 2nd century, we see the **warning intensify** as the church faced new challenges: **baptized believers must persevere in holiness, and those who turn back to a life of sin face eternal condemnation unless they urgently repent**. Ignatius declares that those who persist in sin or heresy "shall not inherit the kingdom" and face "everlasting fire." Hermas urgently warns that "the repentance of the righteous has limits" and that continued sin after baptism puts salvation in jeopardy.

Neither church father taught that a Christian could live in ongoing, unrepentant sin and still be assured of salvation. On the contrary, they explicitly warned that such a lifestyle leads to **exclusion from God's kingdom**. They affirmed both God's mercy for the truly penitent and His judgment on the persistently rebellious – even among the baptized.

This historical witness stands as a powerful challenge to modern notions of "cheap grace" or "carnal Christianity." The 2nd century church's message to someone trapped in habitual sin would be urgent and clear: *"You are on the way of death. Do not be deceived. Repent immediately and turn from this sin, or you will perish. The time for repentance may be shorter than you think."*

In our next chapter, we will see how this same sobering message continued in the 3rd and 4th centuries through the voices of Cyprian, Chrysostom, and Augustine, who faced even greater challenges as Christianity became more mainstream and the temptation toward spiritual complacency grew.
