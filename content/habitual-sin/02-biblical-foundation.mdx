# Chapter 2: "Be Not Deceived": The Bible's Warnings to Believers

Scripture confronts us with **unmistakable warnings** that a lifestyle of willful sin is incompatible with salvation. Far from offering carnal Christians a free pass, the Word of God repeatedly declares that **those who persist in disobedience will be excluded from God's kingdom**. In this chapter, we will briefly examine key biblical passages – without intricate commentary – allowing the force of the text to speak plainly. These verses span multiple authors and testaments, yet they form a consistent witness: *only those who **continue in faith and holiness** will finally be saved.* The **flip side** is equally clear: those who *claim* to belong to Christ yet *"practice sin"* will face eternal death unless they repent. As we compile these scriptures (all quotes are from the NASB for clarity), remember that many of them were originally addressed *to Christians*. The apostles did not hesitate to warn believers about the danger of being deceived regarding sin. Let the reader approach these verses with a humble, open heart – perhaps as if hearing them for the first time – and allow the Holy Spirit to apply them personally.

## "No Inheritance in the Kingdom" – Warnings from Paul's Epistles

The Apostle **Paul** makes it painfully clear that certain behaviors, if practiced unrepentantly, bar a person from eternal life. Writing to the **Corinthian** church – which included some who had a background of sexual sin and other vices – Paul warns bluntly:

*"Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God."* (<BibleVerse reference="1 Corinthians 6:9-10" />)

It is difficult to imagine a more straightforward statement. Paul knew that believers might be tempted to **rationalize** ongoing sins (perhaps thinking, "Surely God wouldn't exclude *us*, we're saved by grace!"). So he prefaces the vice list by saying *"Do not be deceived."* In other words, let no one trick you with empty assurances: people who live in these patterns – sexual immorality, false worship, theft and greed, substance abuse, abusive speech, cheating others – **have no inheritance in God's kingdom**. Paul does not caveat, *"unless they once accepted Christ, in which case they're safe."* No – he states a general truth applicable to *anyone*. He then reminds the Corinthians that **true conversion produces a break from such sins**: *"Such were some of you; but you were washed… sanctified… justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ"* (<BibleVerse reference="1 Corinthians 6:11" />). The Christians at Corinth had been **cleansed and set apart** from those old identities. How unthinkable, then, for any of them to return to those sins and yet presume to **still inherit the kingdom**! The warning stands: a **"Christian" who becomes again a fornicator, drunkard, etc., and persists without repentance, will by no means be saved**. *"Do not be deceived."*

Paul issues nearly **identical warnings** to other churches. To the **Galatians**, he writes that *"the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit"* (<BibleVerse reference="Galatians 5:17" />), and he lists the "deeds of the flesh" as *"immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these."* Then Paul, the preacher of justification by faith, adds this emphatic conclusion:

*"Of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God."* (<BibleVerse reference="Galatians 5:19-21" />)

Here again, the **inheritance of the kingdom** is conditional: if you *"practice such things"* (live habitually in these sins), you exclude yourself. In fact, Paul says he has warned them of this repeatedly (*"as I have forewarned you"*). Grace does not grant immunity to an impenitent sinner. A professing Christian who persists in *any* of these works of the flesh – whether sexual impurity, idolatry/occult practice, or relational sins like fits of anger and divisiveness – **will forfeit the kingdom of God**. This is a sobering reality. Paul is not afraid it will undermine *sola fide*; rather, he sees it as integral to the gospel call. Those truly justified by faith *also receive the Spirit*, who leads them away from the domination of such sins. *"If we live by the Spirit,"* Paul concludes, *"let us also walk by the Spirit"* (<BibleVerse reference="Galatians 5:25" />). Any "faith" that produces only the **works of the flesh** and not the **fruit of the Spirit** (<BibleVerse reference="Galatians 5:22-23" />) is no saving faith at all (cf. <BibleVerse reference="James 2:17" />).

In Paul's letter to the **Ephesians**, we find a similar list and warning. He says *"immorality or any impurity or greed"* must not even be named among saints, and adds:

*"For this you know with certainty, that no immoral or impure person or covetous man, who is an idolater, has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience."* (<BibleVerse reference="Ephesians 5:5-6" />)

Note the phrasing "*with certainty*" – Paul wants zero doubt on this point. Someone whose life is characterized by sexual immorality, impurity (a broader term for uncleanness), or greedy idolatry (essentially, unchecked covetousness/materialism which amounts to worshiping a false god) – **such a person is not going to inherit Christ's kingdom**. Period. Again he anticipates the **"empty words"** of false teachers who might say otherwise ("God won't really exclude you; you're His people!"). Paul insists that those very sins **incur God's wrath** on the disobedient. How could anyone claiming to be saved take part in what provokes God's holy anger? *"Do not be partners with them,"* he immediately adds (<BibleVerse reference="Ephesians 5:7" />). The clear implication is that **if we live like "sons of disobedience," we will share their fate under wrath**. Our identity must be proven by our deeds; those united to Christ walk in light, not darkness (<BibleVerse reference="Ephesians 5:8" />).

Thus, three times Paul lists **specific sins** and plainly states that practitioners of such **will not enter heaven**. These are not isolated proof-texts but a consistent apostolic teaching, conveyed to multiple churches. We could add that **John in Revelation** agrees, for he writes that in the New Jerusalem *"nothing unclean, and no one who practices abomination and lying, shall ever come into it"* (<BibleVerse reference="Revelation 21:27" />). Earlier he records that *"the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and **sexually immoral persons** and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars"* will have *"their part... in the lake that burns with fire... the second death."* (<BibleVerse reference="Revelation 21:8" />). The **end of the story** has the same moral as all these epistles: sin may seem to triumph for a season, but **every unrepentant sinner will be barred from God's glorious kingdom** and instead will meet with eternal fire. The apostles and Scripture authors did not soften that reality even when addressing *baptized believers*. They loved their readers enough to warn them: do not be deceived – a name on a church roll, a past experience, or a mere profession of faith means nothing if you **choose a life of unrighteousness**. **Grace is amazing**, but *"God is not mocked"*: *"the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap **corruption**"* (<BibleVerse reference="Galatians 6:7-8" />). As Paul told the **Romans**, *"if you are living according to the flesh, **you must die**; but if by the Spirit you are putting to death the deeds of the body, **you will live**"* (<BibleVerse reference="Romans 8:13" />). **Eternal life and death** hang in the balance, depending on whether we crucify our flesh or cater to it.

## Warnings to Continue: "If We Deny Him…" – Perseverance in the Pastoral Epistles

The New Testament also contains conditional warnings in the form of **"if"** statements, underscoring that continuing in Christ is necessary. For example, Paul teaches Timothy:

*"It is a trustworthy statement: for if we died with Him, we will also live with Him; if we endure, we will also reign with Him; if we deny Him, He also will deny us; if we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself."* (<BibleVerse reference="2 Timothy 2:11-13" />)

This early Christian hymn (as it appears to be) contrasts the outcome of **endurance** versus **denial**. Reigning with Christ is promised **only to those who endure**. By contrast, **if a believer were to deny Christ**, Christ will be faithful to His holiness and **deny that person** – echoing Jesus' own words: *"Whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father"* (<BibleVerse reference="Matthew 10:33" />). It is a sobering possibility. Some interpreters soften 2 Timothy 2:13 ("if we are faithless…") to refer to occasional lapses, saying Christ still keeps us. But the context strongly implies that **"faithless"** (without faith) is parallel to denying Him – hence a final falling away. Christ remains faithful to His threat in that case: He *cannot deny Himself* or contradict His own Word. Thus, even here, with a positive tone of encouragement (*"let's endure and live with Him!"*), the **negative warning stands**: *we must not deny our Lord*, whether by word or by persistently disobeying Him as Lord. This warning would certainly apply to those effectively **denying Christ by their deeds** (<BibleVerse reference="Titus 1:16" />). The Apostle John likewise wrote, *"If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, **we lie** and do not practice the truth"* (<BibleVerse reference="1 John 1:6" />). **Talk is cheap**; a lifestyle of disobedience "denies" Christ regardless of our church-talk. But *"let everyone who names the name of the Lord abstain from wickedness"* (<BibleVerse reference="2 Timothy 2:19" />).

## "Today, If You Hear His Voice…" – Exhortations from Hebrews

Perhaps the **strongest warnings in the New Testament** are found in the Epistle to the **Hebrews**. These were written to professing Christians who were tempted to *"shrink back"* (<BibleVerse reference="Hebrews 10:38" />) from the costly path of discipleship. The author employs some of the most unsettling language in Scripture to jolt them (and us) to persevere. We will consider two major passages: Hebrews 6 and 10. Keep in mind, these warnings appear *within* a letter that also magnificently teaches Christ's sufficiency and God's promises. The presence of these warnings shows that *assurance* and *exhortation* go hand in hand – true believers take heed and thus continue in faith.

**Hebrews 6:4–8** speaks of the dreadful fate of apostasy:

*"For in the case of those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, and then have fallen away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance, since they again crucify to themselves the Son of God and put Him to open shame. For ground that drinks the rain... and yields thorns and thistles, it is worthless and close to being cursed, and it ends up being burned."* (<BibleVerse reference="Hebrews 6:4-8" />)

This passage describes people who clearly were within the community of believers – *enlightened* (baptized and taught), *tasted* the heavenly gift and the Spirit's grace, even experiencing the goodness of God's Word. And yet, shockingly, they later **"fall away"** (the Greek term *parapipto*, meaning to commit apostasy). The text soberly states that **renewal to repentance becomes impossible** for such, because by their willful departure they effectively **re-crucify Christ** – treating Him with contempt despite having known His grace. This is not describing a momentary lapse or struggle, but a decisive repudiation of Christ's lordship (whether by explicit renunciation or by hardened, continual disobedience). The **imagery of land and rain** then drives it home: a field that ought to produce vegetation but instead yields only thorns is about to be cursed and burned. This clearly alludes to **final judgment** by fire. In other words, those who **turn back decisively from Christ** after receiving His truth have no second remedy – they are like barren land destined for burning. While interpretations vary, the **plain sense** is that a person can come *very far* in association with Christ – even receive the Spirit's influences – and yet, by *falling away*, end up damned with no further opportunity to repent. This utterly demolishes the notion that *"once saved, always saved"* as a **guarantee regardless of behavior**. True believers must take this as a **warning to persevere** and not even flirt with the thought of forsaking Christ for sin.

Equally severe is **Hebrews 10:26–31**, which warns against deliberate, ongoing sin after knowing the gospel:

*"For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a terrifying expectation of judgment and the fury of a fire which will consume the adversaries. Anyone who has set aside the Law of Moses dies without mercy... How much severer punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace? ...'The Lord will judge His people.' It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God."* (<BibleVerse reference="Hebrews 10:26-31" />)

Here the author includes himself with the word "**we**" – *"if we go on sinning willfully…"* – showing this is a real warning to the community of professing believers. To "sin willfully" in context means to **knowingly persist in sin** (any sin, but especially the sin of repudiating Christ), as opposed to stumbling out of weakness. The consequence is dire: *"no sacrifice for sins remains."* If one spurns Christ's sacrifice through persistent disobedience, there is **no further remedy** from God – only judgment. By using Old Testament law as a lesser example (where apostates were executed), he argues that **rejecting Christ's covenant** is even worse, meriting a *"much severer punishment."* Notice the apostate is described as one who **was sanctified by Christ's blood** (at least in outward covenant terms) yet later calls that blood "unclean" – as if treating Jesus' sacrifice as worthless. This person **insults the Spirit of grace** – the very Spirit who testifies to Christ. All this language points to someone who *started as a Christian*, then willfully abandoned holiness and faith. The conclusion leaves us trembling: *God will judge His people* – yes, *His own people* – if they forsake His Son. *"It is a terrifying thing to fall into [His] hands."*

We must not blunt this edge: **a Christian who "goes on sinning willfully" is on the path to fiery judgment**. Some try to limit Hebrews 10:26 to the "sin" of reverting to Judaism. But verse 26 does not so limit it – *"sinning willfully"* is broad. In truth, any **willful continuation in known sin** is a form of trampling Christ underfoot. When one stubbornly refuses to repent, he treats Christ's blood lightly, as if it neither cleanses nor deserves his allegiance. Such a person is effectively saying, *"Jesus died for me, but I don't regard His lordship or holiness – I'll keep my beloved sin."* This is an **insult to the Spirit of grace**. The Scripture leaves no room for comfort here: if that pattern persists, **no sacrifice covers those sins**. The only destiny is "fury of fire." How many in our churches today **"go on sinning willfully"** – whether it be viewing pornography regularly, cheating in business, nursing bitterness, or any number of habitual sins – all the while assuming grace will cover it? The Word of God says otherwise: such persons should expect *judgment, not mercy*, unless they repent. These are not our words but God's. It is *loving* to press this truth on any who are toying with damnation through cherished sin.

Hebrews also echoes earlier the warning from Psalm 95: *"Today if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts"* (<BibleVerse reference="Hebrews 3:7" />). The writer exhorts believers to *"encourage one another day after day… so that none of you will be **hardened by the deceitfulness of sin**"* (<BibleVerse reference="Hebrews 3:13" />). Sin is **treacherous** – it lies to us, gradually hardening our conscience until repentance becomes humanly impossible. Thus, even apart from final apostasy, there is the very real danger of a **Christian's heart growing hard** and unbelieving, leading them to fall away: *"Take care, brethren, that there not be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart **that falls away from the living God**"* (<BibleVerse reference="Hebrews 3:12" />). Notice he addresses them as "brethren" yet warns of departing from God – showing again that the threat is real, not hypothetical. The only safeguard is to respond to God **today**, in the moment of conviction – not to delay repentance. One who continually **hardens himself** may cross a line where he cannot soften again. The example given is the Israelites who perished in the wilderness: *"And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest, but to those who were **disobedient**? So we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief"* (<BibleVerse reference="Hebrews 3:18-19" />). Disobedience and unbelief are two sides of the same coin. If we persist in disobedience, we show an evil heart of unbelief and may forfeit the eternal "rest" promised to God's people.

## "No One Born of God Sins" – The Test of 1 John

We turn now to the Apostle **John**, whose first epistle addresses the marks of a true Christian. John's letter is full of assurances of God's love and grace, yet it also contains **uncompromising tests of obedience**. Contrary to the false teachers of his day (and ours), John insists that *continuance in sin* is incompatible with being a child of God. Consider these piercing words:

*"No one who abides in Him sins; no one who sins has seen Him or knows Him. Little children, make sure no one deceives you; the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous; the one who practices sin is of the devil… No one who is born of God practices sin, because His seed abides in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. By this the children of God and the children of the devil are obvious: anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor the one who does not love his brother."* (<BibleVerse reference="1 John 3:6-10" />)

Here again we see the *"make sure no one deceives you"* caution. Evidently, even in the first-century church some were claiming one could *know God* while living in sin. John will have none of it. To *"sin"* in this passage means to **live in ongoing, unrepented sin** (present tense Greek verbs indicate continuous action). John is not saying a Christian never commits an act of sin (indeed, he earlier says *"if we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves"* – <BibleVerse reference="1 John 1:8" />). Rather, he's drawing a line between a life characterized by **practicing sin** versus **practicing righteousness**. The difference is stark and "obvious," as he says. If someone's life is a continuous pattern of sin – obeying sinful desires as a rule – that person "belongs to the devil," regardless of what they profess. They *"have not seen or known"* Christ in truth (v.6). Conversely, the one **truly born again** has God's "seed" (life) in him, which keeps him from surrendering to sin's power. There will be an overall pattern of righteousness, however imperfectly.

John's emphasis is that **saving fellowship with God transforms one's behavior**. Any "Christian" who is *indistinguishable from a child of the devil* in conduct **is in fact a child of the devil**. Strong words! But necessary. John lovingly addresses the readers as "little children," reinforcing that this truth guards them from deception. It parallels Paul's *"do not be deceived"* and Hebrews' warnings. We cannot claim to be justified by Christ if we make peace with what **Christ died to destroy** (the works of the devil, v.8). Earlier in the epistle, John put it succinctly: *"By this we know that we have come to know Him, **if we keep His commandments**. The one who says 'I have come to know Him' and does not keep His commandments **is a liar**, and the truth is not in him"* (<BibleVerse reference="1 John 2:3-4" />). Again, the **identity** (knowing God) is verified by the **habit of obedience**. If a person habitually breaks Christ's commands, their claim to know Him is false – they are lying, perhaps even to themselves.

What commandments does John have in mind? Primarily the commands to **believe in Christ and to love one another** (<BibleVerse reference="1 John 3:23" />). But also all that Christ and His apostles taught, which certainly includes moral purity. John specifically mentions *"the one who does not love his brother"* is not of God (3:10), and he later adds that *"no murderer has eternal life abiding in him"* (<BibleVerse reference="1 John 3:15" />) and *"if someone says 'I love God' and hates his brother, he is a liar"* (<BibleVerse reference="1 John 4:20" />). These are further examples of the principle: **a real relationship with God is incompatible with a life of hatred, murder, or any such darkness**. Similarly, Revelation 21:8 (which we cited earlier) listed "all liars" and the sexually immoral as having their part in the lake of fire – showing that **living in falsehood or immorality is utterly irreconcilable with being saved**.

Returning to **sexual sin in particular** (the focus of our book): Jesus taught that lusting after a woman in one's heart is akin to adultery (<BibleVerse reference="Matthew 5:27-28" />). A Christian man who persists in consuming pornography is thus *practicing adultery in heart* repeatedly. Can a man do this and truly *"abide in Christ"* at the same time? John's answer would be *no*. If one *"makes a practice"* of sexual immorality, that person cannot simultaneously claim to be *"born of God"*. Paul told the **Thessalonians**, *"this is the will of God, your sanctification; that is, that you **abstain from sexual immorality**"* (<BibleVerse reference="1 Thessalonians 4:3" />). He then warned that *"the Lord is an avenger in all these things... because God has not called us for the purpose of impurity"* (<BibleVerse reference="1 Thessalonians 4:6-7" />). To *continue* willfully in sexual impurity is to defy the very purpose of God's calling and to put oneself in line for God's avenging judgment. John would categorize such a one not as a struggling Christian, but as *"not of God"* if there is no repentance. This is not to discourage someone who *is* fighting and repenting daily – rather, it is to **expose the lie** of the person who says, *"I'm a Christian"* but has **settled into** a pattern of porn use, adultery, or any sin without genuine striving for holiness. Scripture says that claim of knowing God is *null and void*.

## "He Who Overcomes…" – Only the Victorious Inherit the Promises

A final thread in Scripture's warning tapestry is the repeated call to **overcome or persevere**. In the Book of **Revelation**, Jesus dictates letters to seven churches (Revelation chapters 2–3). Each letter contains promises *"to him who overcomes."* For example:

*"He who overcomes, and he who keeps My deeds **until the end**, to him I will give authority over the nations"* (<BibleVerse reference="Revelation 2:26" />).

*"Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life… He who overcomes will not be hurt by the second death."* (<BibleVerse reference="Revelation 2:10-11" />).

*"He who overcomes will thus be clothed in white garments; and I will not erase his name from the book of life"* (<BibleVerse reference="Revelation 3:5" />).

*"He who overcomes, I will grant to him to sit down with Me on My throne, as I also overcame"* (<BibleVerse reference="Revelation 3:21" />).

In the **final chapter of Scripture**, Jesus says: *"He who overcomes will inherit these things, and I will be his God and he will be My son. **But for the cowardly and unbelieving and… all liars, their part will be in the lake that burns with fire**"* (<BibleVerse reference="Revelation 21:7-8" />). We see here a **divide**: the overcomers versus the faithless. To overcome means to hold fast to Christ by faith, evidenced in faithfulness and repentance, even amidst trials or temptations. It does *not* mean sinless perfection, but it does mean *persevering resistance* to the world, flesh, and devil by Christ's power. Jesus implicitly defines overcoming in Rev 2:26 as *"keeping My deeds until the end."* Note that: the overcomer is one who *obeys Christ's works to the end*.

Thus, all the blessed promises of eternal life, divine sonship, ruling with Christ, etc., are reserved **for those who endure and overcome**. Conversely, those who **shrink back, give up, or live in cowardly unbelief** will *not* inherit, but face the second death (<BibleVerse reference="Revelation 21:8" />). This is perfectly consistent with everything we've seen. *"By your endurance you will gain your lives,"* Jesus taught (<BibleVerse reference="Luke 21:19" />). And *"the one who endures to the end, he will be saved"* (<BibleVerse reference="Matthew 24:13" />). These statements were given to disciples in contexts of persecution, but they apply broadly: **only a faith that endures to the finish is true faith**. A "faith" that gets choked out by lust or worldliness and does not *finish* the race will not save (cf. the parable of the soils, <BibleVerse reference="Luke 8:13-14" />). Paul likened the Christian life to a boxing match or a race, saying *"I discipline my body and make it my slave, so that, after I have preached to others, **I myself will not be disqualified**"* (<BibleVerse reference="1 Corinthians 9:27" />). Even the apostle recognized that *he* had to persevere in holiness, lest he be disqualified (rejected) in the end. How much more should we take heed!

Before moving on, let us dispel a misunderstanding: **None of these scriptures teach salvation by our own works or merits**. Rather, they teach the **necessity of holiness as the fruit of genuine faith**. Believers are saved by grace through faith in Christ, *"not as a result of works"* (<BibleVerse reference="Ephesians 2:8-9" />). *But* the next verse says *"we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus **for good works**, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them"* (<BibleVerse reference="Ephesians 2:10" />). A true convert will have a life marked by those good works. If those works are utterly absent – if instead one's "walk" is characterized by the **works of the flesh** – it indicates the person has not been savingly united to Christ. Thus, the warnings serve to shake false professors out of their deception and to spur true believers onward in fear and trembling. Far from contradicting grace, these exhortations **are grace** – God's means to keep us clinging to Christ. When Paul told the Romans *"if you live according to the flesh you must die,"* he immediately added *"but if by the Spirit you are putting to death the deeds of the body, you will live"* (<BibleVerse reference="Romans 8:13" />). In other words, **God's Spirit empowers the Christian to *kill sin*** – and *that* is the path of life. Indeed, *"if we walk by the Spirit, we will not carry out the desire of the flesh"* (<BibleVerse reference="Galatians 5:16" />). The true believer **has access to power** to overcome. The false believer complacently *"lives according to the flesh,"* perhaps citing *"grace"* while doing so, and thus proves he doesn't have the Spirit (<BibleVerse reference="Romans 8:9" />) – unless he repents and seeks God's mercy for transformation.

Let us summarize the biblical testimony in plain terms: **Professing Christians who practice sexual immorality (such as viewing pornography habitually), drunkenness, hatred, deceit, or any other willful sin, are on course for damnation, not salvation.** They **must not comfort themselves with false assurances**. The Word of God commands such people to *repent* or perish. As Paul succinctly said, *"If we deny Him, He will also deny us"* (<BibleVerse reference="2 Timothy 2:12" />). And *"Do not be deceived… no sexually immoral persons… will inherit the Kingdom of God"* (<BibleVerse reference="1 Corinthians 6:9-10" />). On the positive side, **if we confess and forsake our sins, trusting in Christ, He is ready to forgive and cleanse us** (<BibleVerse reference="1 John 1:9" />). There is abundant pardon for the penitent. But the pardon is never given *to those who determine to cling to their sin*. Jesus asked, *"Why do you call Me 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say?"* (<BibleVerse reference="Luke 6:46" />). That haunting question should compel each of us to examine ourselves. If you call Jesus "Lord" but continue to *serve lust and self*, you are deceiving yourself. You cannot have both Christ and your sin. *"You cannot serve two masters"* (<BibleVerse reference="Matthew 6:24" />). **Choose this day whom you will serve.** The next chapters will show that this exact message – that only those who persist in obedience will be saved, and that Christians living in gross sin will face hell – has been the consistent teaching of faithful Christians throughout history.

Before proceeding, hear one more plea from Scripture itself, one that beautifully balances warning and hope:

*"Pursue peace with all men, and the holiness without which no one will see the Lord. See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God… that there be no immoral or godless person like Esau, who sold his own birthright for a single meal. For you know that even afterwards, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought for it with tears."* (<BibleVerse reference="Hebrews 12:14-17" />)

Holiness is absolutely necessary to see the Lord – there are no exceptions. And the window of repentance can close if one sells Christ for a moment of sin and later tries to reclaim the blessing. Do not be like Esau. If you have been **trading away your heavenly birthright** for the bitter pleasure of pornography (or any sin), *stop now and weep for your soul*. Seek the Lord while He may be found. *Today* is the day of salvation. The *grace of God* is mighty to forgive and renew – but **it is only found on the path of repentance**. Turn, forsake your sin, and run to Christ in obedient faith. Otherwise, the fury of fire waits to consume the adversaries. These are not our words; they are God's. We implore you to heed them.

## Key Points

- Persistent sin excludes believers from the kingdom.
- Salvation requires enduring faith and holiness.
- God patiently calls us to repentance today.
