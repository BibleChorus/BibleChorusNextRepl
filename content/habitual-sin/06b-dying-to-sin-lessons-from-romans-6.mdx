True repentance begins with a kind of **death**. This sounds frightening, but it is a blessed death: **death to sin, death to the old self**. Romans 6, as we saw, teaches that every Christian has died with Christ. Repentance is essentially **bringing our life into alignment with that death**. It is *acting out* what is already positionally true: “I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me” (Gal. 2:20). When a believer who has fallen into sin comes under conviction, the path forward is to **embrace the cross anew**—to agree with God that “the old me” (the porn-watching me, the lying me, the angry me, etc.) deserves to die, and through Christ *has died*.

What does this look like practically? It means a complete and unreserved yielding of oneself to God. Paul said, <i>“do not go on presenting the parts of your body to sin as instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead”<BibleVerse reference="Romans 6:13" /></i>. If you are repenting of sexual sin, for example, you consciously yield your eyes to God (to bounce them away from lustful images), your hands to God (to use your computer/phone for good, not evil), your mind to God (to take captive lustful thoughts in obedience to Christ). And you do this not in a merely ritualistic way, but <b>“from the heart”</b>, out of love for the God who saved you (Rom. 6:17).

Dying to sin also involves a kind of warfare, a violent renunciation. Colossians 3:5 urges, *“Therefore consider the members of your earthly body as dead to immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire…”* The old term is “mortify” (put to death) these things. **Repentance is not anemic; it is vigorous.** Jesus said if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out; if your hand causes sin, cut it off (Matt. 5:29–30). That imagery tells us repentance may require **drastic action**. If internet pornography is your snare, “pluck out the eye” might mean getting rid of your smartphone or installing strict accountability filters and giving someone else the password. It might mean literally disconnecting your home internet for a season, if that’s what it takes. Some would call that extreme; Jesus calls it better to lose those conveniences than to be cast into hell. If a dating relationship is pulling you into sexual sin, repentance likely means ending that relationship. If certain friends entice you to drink or do drugs, repentance means cutting off those friendships (at least until you are strong enough to influence them rather than be influenced). **These choices feel like a kind of death—death to self, death to comfort, death to what our flesh enjoys.** But they lead to life.

Romans 6:16 adds a profound insight: <i>“Do you not know that when you present yourselves to someone as slaves for obedience, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin <b>resulting in death</b>, or of obedience <b>resulting in righteousness</b>?”<BibleVerse reference="Romans 6:16" /></i>. Paul personifies Sin and Obedience as two masters. We have a choice whom to offer ourselves to. Continuing in sin is not a neutral or lesser choice—it’s choosing a master who pays in death. Repentance is choosing obedience as our new master (which, we know, is really yielding to God as Master). The <i>result</i> of consistent obedience is increasing righteousness, which means a character conformed to Christ. This is a litmus test: <b>If we are truly repentant, we will consistently choose obedience over sin going forward</b>. Not that we become sinlessly perfect overnight, but our trajectory and loyalty change. We switch sides in the war. We stop making excuses and start making war on our sins.

One might ask, *“But what if I have repented before and then fallen again? Is my repentance real? Can I truly die to sin when it seems to keep reviving?”* This is a crucial pastoral question. The answer is twofold: First, we should never make peace with sin on the grounds that “I always fall.” That is fatalism, not faith. The righteous may fall seven times and rise again (Prov. 24:16), yes, but he rises to continue the fight. So even if you have fallen a hundred times, **the call now is to repent *again*** — but more deeply and resolutely than ever before, learning from past failures. Second, examine *why* the past attempts failed. Sometimes what we called “repentance” was merely **remorse or half-measures**. Perhaps after indulging you felt bad and told God “I’m sorry,” but took no serious steps to remove the opportunity to sin. That’s not full repentance. Or perhaps you repented sincerely, but you neglected to fill the void with seeking God (you only tried to not sin, which left you vulnerable). True repentance is both **“putting off”** the old and **“putting on”** the new (Eph. 4:22–24). You can’t just stop looking at porn; you must start investing in prayer, Scripture, serving others—so that your life is filled with righteousness, leaving less room for the flesh.

Romans 6 encourages us that slavery to righteousness **grows** on us: *“Just as you used to offer yourselves to impurity... **resulting in further lawlessness**, so now offer yourselves to righteousness, **resulting in sanctification**.”* (Rom. 6:19). Sin tends to snowball (one sin leads to more). But likewise, acts of obedience and devotion snowball into greater sanctification. The more we obey, the easier obedience becomes; holy habits replace sinful habits. This is hopeful for someone struggling: start the momentum of obedience, even if small, and watch it gain strength by God’s grace.

Therefore, **dying to sin in repentance is both a decisive crisis and an ongoing process.** There is a decisive moment (or moments) where you say before God, “Enough! I renounce this evil. I belong to Christ.” That is where, spiritually, the “death” is reckoned. Then, each day, you carry the cross by reinforcing that decision—*“I die daily”* as Paul says (1 Cor. 15:31)—making choices consistent with your initial surrender. In practical terms, an actually repentant person doesn’t plan to sin anymore. They plan not to. They install safeguards, they seek accountability, they restructure their routines to avoid known pitfalls. If one simply says “sorry” after sin but changes nothing, it is likely **worldly sorrow** (feeling bad about consequences) rather than **godly sorrow** (feeling the offense against God and determining to change) (see 2 Cor. 7:10). Godly sorrow leads to repentance *“without regret, leading to salvation”*, and Paul describes it as producing *“earnestness… vindication… indignation… fear… longing… zeal… avenging of wrong”* (2 Cor. 7:11). These are the emotions of someone who has *died* to their sin: they are earnest (serious now), eager to clear themselves, indignant at their sin, fearful of grieving God, longing to be restored fully, zealous to do right, and eager to see justice (even accepting consequences). This is a helpful biblical checklist for our hearts. True repentance is *not* casual.

However, we must stress: **this death to sin is impossible on our own.** It is only by union with Christ’s death and by the power of the Holy Spirit that we can carry it out. That is why any practical step we take must be done in prayerful dependence. If you dump your whiskey bottles out, do it praying, “Lord, in Your strength I cast this away—sustain me.” If you cancel the internet, do it saying, “Jesus, You are more precious to me than any convenience.” Repentance divorced from reliance on God can become self-righteous asceticism. But repentance *with* reliance becomes a sweet offering to God and a doorway to deeper intimacy with Him.

In summary, **Romans 6 teaches us that believers are dead to sin and alive to God.** Our call in repentance is to live out that reality: consider it true, present ourselves to God, and refuse any longer to let sin reign. **It is a fight unto death—sin’s death, not ours—and Christ has assured victory to those who fight in His strength.**
