# Preface
This brief book was drafted entirely with the assistance of *ChatGPT Deep Research*, an artificialintelligence tool I prompted and supervised. I chose this method because, after many years as a Christian who once minimized the eternal danger of habitual sin, through God’s great patience and mercy I finally repented and discovered how urgently the church needs a clear, unflinching warning call. AI enabled me to gather Scripture, history, and contemporary data quickly and present them in a concentrated form for fellow believers who may be where I once was.

Sadly, the numbers justify this alarm. <b>Pornography is now mainstream inside the church:</b> a recent Barna study found <i>just over half of practicing Christians admit using porn</i>, with <b>22 percent viewing it weekly or daily</b> [<i><sup>Barna Group</sup></i>](https://www.barna.com/trends/over-half-of-practicing-christians-admit-they-use-pornography/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Even pastors are not immune: <b>67 percent confess they have struggled with pornography</b>, and 18 percent say it is a <i>current</i> battle [<i><sup>Barna Group</sup></i>](https://www.barna.com/research/pastors-pornography-use/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Alcohol abuse tells a similar story. Pew Research reports that among U.S. adults who attend worship at least monthly, <b>13 percent engaged in bingedrinking during the previous month</b>—four/five or more drinks in one sitting [<i><sup>Pew Research Center</sup></i>](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/03/06/americans-drinking-habits-vary-by-faith/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). These figures expose a church culture in which sins that Scripture links to damnation are quietly tolerated.

# Chapter 1: Introduction
The purpose of this book is plain and urgent: <b>to warn believers that continuing in known sin, such as pornography or drunkenness, puts their salvation in jeopardy.</b> Scripture gives no guarantee that a person delaying repentance will find it later. <i>“Today if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts”</i> (Hebrews 3:15, NASB) – this plea rings out because tomorrow is not promised. God’s word insists that <b>now</b> is the time to repent and obey, <i>“Behold, now is ‘the acceptable time,’ behold, now is ‘the day of salvation’”[<sup>biblehub.com</sup></i>](https://biblehub.com/nasb/2_corinthians/6-2.htm#:~:text=NASB%201995%20for%20He%20says%2C,THE%20DAY%20OF%20SALVATION)</i>. A Christian who persists in willful sin is presuming on God’s grace and <b>may awaken too late</b> to the reality that grace does not excuse ongoing disobedience. Many will be lost because they misapply doctrines like <i>sola fide</i> (faith alone) or <i>“once saved, always saved,”</i> imagining that a one-time profession of faith or a general love of sound doctrine will save them even as they <i>“go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth”</i> – a choice for which <i>“there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins”[<sup>nasb.literalword.com</sup></i>](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=Hebrews+10%3A26-39#:~:text=26%20For%20if%20we%20go,a%20terrifying%20thing%20to%20fall)</i>. The loving but firm warning of this book is that we must not deceive ourselves: <b>continued rebellion, even under the banner of Christianity, leads to eternal death</b>. <i>“If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit”</i> (Galatians 5:25 NASB); if instead we make peace with sin, we risk being severed from Christ. Repent now, while God’s patience calls out to you.

To impress the urgency of repentance, consider two realistic scenarios of believers who *“misunderstand grace”* and delay turning from their sin:

**Scenario 1 – The “Struggling” Young Christian:** A young man in his twenties loves theology and confidently champions *sola fide* – the doctrine that we are justified by faith alone. He is active in his church and delights in sound teaching. Outwardly, his life seems orderly. Inwardly, however, he battles a secret pattern of viewing pornography. He tells himself he’s *“struggling”* with this sin, as if the mere internal conflict were enough. After each lapse into lust, guilt floods his heart. He earnestly prays for forgiveness, confessing his sin to God with tears in his eyes. Yet he has done this **dozens or even hundreds** of times. By now a troubling routine has set in: temptation – failure – remorse – a promise to do better – and then a return to the same mire.

This young Christian truly believes in Jesus and cherishes the gospel of grace. He remembers that <i>“by grace [we] have been saved through faith… not as a result of works”</i> (Ephesians 2:8–9, NASB)[<i><sup>nasb.literalword.com</sup></i>](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=Ephesians+2%3A8-10#:~:text=8%20For%20by%20grace%20you,we%20would%20walk%20in%20them). He reassures himself that he is <i>“not saved by moral perfection.”</i> When accusing thoughts arise – <i>“How can you be a Christian and keep doing this?”</i> – he counters them with promises of God’s love and patience. In his mind, his pornography habit is a <b>flaw</b> or a <i>“struggle common to many men,”</i> not an outright rebellion. He does not <b>defend</b> pornography; he despises it and feels ashamed. Yet in the quiet of his heart, he also does not <b>forsake</b> it. He believes he’ll eventually overcome it, perhaps through accountability or marriage, but he feels no urgency to cut off this sin immediately. After all (he reasons), <i>everyone struggles, and God understands</i>. He takes a kind of misguided comfort in calling himself <i>“a wretch saved by grace,”</i> as if repeatedly quoting <i>“no one is righteous, not even one”</i> could excuse remaining in known impurity. His doctrine has taught him to distrust any hint of “works-based salvation,” so he shies away from preaching that seems too hard on sin. When he hears a sermon on Jesus’s warning – <i>“if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it from you”</i> (Matthew 5:30 NASB) – he feels a stab of conviction. But soon he relaxes, thinking, <i>“I do hate my sin. I’m just not perfect yet. Thank God for grace. I’ll repent for real someday.”</i> In this way, he lulls his conscience with half-truths. He has <b>good theology in theory</b>, but he is blind to the gravity of practicing what God hates. In effect, he is <i>“receiving the grace of God in vain”</i> (2 Corinthians 6:1), presuming that grace means he can safely dabble in sin a little longer. What he fails to realize is that every indulgence hardens his heart and makes repentance more difficult. He is racing toward a spiritual crisis: unless he wakes up and <i>“puts to death the deeds of the body”</i> (Romans 8:13), his <b>faith will die</b>. Though he calls Jesus “Lord,” if he will not obey, he will not enter the Kingdom (cf. Matthew 7:21).

**Scenario 2 – The Complacent Older Believer:** An older man in his sixties has been a Christian for decades. He has served faithfully in the church, raised a family, and gained a reputation as a wise, mature believer. He can say with Paul, in a sense, *“I have fought the good fight… I have kept the faith”* (2 Timothy 4:7). Yet despite his fruitful past, he has allowed a particular sin to take root: from time to time, he drinks alcohol to excess, to the point of drunkenness. Perhaps a few times a year – at a wedding, a holiday, or alone in his home under stress – he overindulges and becomes intoxicated. He knows the Bible’s warnings against drunkenness. He has even gently admonished younger men about sobriety. But in his own case, he rationalizes: *“I’m no drunkard; it’s just occasional. I’m normally very self-controlled. This is a minor slip, not a lifestyle.”* He compares himself to true alcoholics or to his own wild youth, and by comparison he feels practically righteous. On nights when he stumbles to bed in a fog of alcohol, he wakes with a bitter conscience. He prays, *“Lord, forgive me. You know I love You. I won’t do that again.”* And for a long while, he doesn’t – until the next occasion months later. Each time, the conviction grows a little fainter. He still believes God is merciful and assumes these lapses won’t *“cost him eternal life.”* Why would they? He’s served God so long. *“Surely the Lord knows I’m but dust,”* he muses (alluding to Psalm 103:14). *“He won’t cast me away for this one weakness.”* In the back of his mind, he recalls the scripture, *“no drunkards... will inherit the kingdom of God,”* but he quickly assures himself that *that* refers to “drunkards” in the sense of habitual alcoholics – not a respectable, long-standing churchman like himself. So he continues in an unrepentant pattern, small in his own eyes but significant before God. This man, too, is on dangerous ground. He has ceased to *“bring forth fruit in keeping with repentance”* (Luke 3:8), instead trusting that a long record of past faithfulness will excuse present disobedience. He has forgotten that **each person’s ongoing choices determine their destiny**: *“if you live according to the flesh, you will die”* (Romans 8:13). His occasional drunkenness is eroding the very sobriety of spirit that he needs to persevere in faith. Unless he repents, he risks hearing Christ say, *“I never knew you; depart from Me”* on the Last Day (Matthew 7:23).

These scenarios are not exaggerations or caricatures. They reflect the real inner reasoning of many professing Christians. Both individuals genuinely <i>identify</i> as believers and even feel affection for God and confidence in doctrine. Yet both are tragically <b>misusing the grace of God</b>. The young man comforts himself with true doctrines (grace, faith, God’s patience) but falsely applies them as a cloak for ongoing immorality. The older man relies on his history of service as though it can balance out willful sin, effectively trusting his past religiosity to nullify God’s clear command to <b>stay sober</b>. In different ways, they each have succumbed to <i>“the deceitfulness of sin”</i> (Hebrews 3:13), which whispers that deliberate sin will not bring death. But God’s Word warns otherwise. Paul wrote bluntly to the Corinthian church that those who live in unrighteousness – including the sexually immoral and drunkards – <i>“will not inherit the kingdom of God.”</i> He added, <i>“Do not be deceived”[<sup>dailyverses.net</sup></i>](https://dailyverses.net/1-corinthians/6/9-10/nasb#:~:text=Or%20do%20you%20not%20know,inherit%20the%20kingdom%20of%20God)</i>. Likewise, to the Ephesians Paul insisted that no immoral or impure person has any inheritance in Christ’s kingdom, and he cautioned: <i>“Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience”[<sup>nasb.literalword.com](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=Ephesians+5%3A1-14#:~:text=coarse%20jesting%2C%20which%20are%20not,7%20Therefore%20do%20not%20be)[nasb.literalword.com</i></sup>](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=Ephesians+5%3A1-14#:~:text=is%20an%20idolater%2C%20has%20an,to%20speak%20of%20the%20things)</i>. The young man’s inner voice saying “it’s just a struggle, you’ll repent later” and the old man’s assurance “a little indulgence won’t matter” – these are exactly the <i>“empty words”</i> that deceive and damn souls. God is not mocked; <i>“whatever a man sows, this he will also reap”</i> (Galatians 6:7–8, NASB). <b>If a believer sows to please his flesh – persists in fleshly sin – he will reap corruption and destruction.</b> No pedigree of sound doctrine or years in church can shield one from God’s judgment if one abandons His commandments. As Peter writes, <i>“if after they have escaped the defilements of the world by the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ they are again entangled in them and are overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first”</i> (2 Peter 2:20 NASB). In other words, a believer who <b>returns to willful sin</b> faces even greater peril.

Dear reader, these warnings are given by God’s love. <i>“See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God”</i> (Hebrews 12:15), the Scripture urges – implying that it is indeed possible to “come short,” to <b>forfeit</b> the grace that was once received. We write with a pastoral burden, knowing that <i>“the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and many... enter through it”</i> (Matthew 7:13). Many of those on the broad road <i>think</i> they are heaven-bound. Some sit in pews, serve in ministry, and confess orthodox creeds, yet <b>cling to a favorite sin</b> under cover of complacency or presumption. But <i>“no creature is hidden from His sight”</i> (Hebrews 4:13). God sees the truth of our lives, and He will not abide rivals in our hearts. His grace is not a license to sin; it is power to live a holy life and the promise of forgiveness <i>conditioned upon repentance</i>. Jesus’s first and continual call is <i>“Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand”</i> (Matthew 4:17). <b>There is zero guarantee that one who refuses that call now will have opportunity later.</b> Esau discovered this to his horror: after selling his birthright for fleshly gratification, he later <i>“desired to inherit the blessing”</i> but <i>“was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought for it with tears”[<sup>nasb.literalword.com</sup></i>](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=Hebrews+12%3A15-17#:~:text=bitterness%20springing%20up%20causes%20trouble%2C,sought%20for%20it%20with%20tears)</i>. The young man with the secret porn habit assumes he can repent on his own timetable – but he may find, when the time comes, that his heart is too hardened to genuinely turn. The old man assumes he will die in comfort and enter glory – but he may find, to his shock, that <i>“the Master will come on a day he does not expect”</i> (Luke 12:46) and <i>“cut him in pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers”</i> (Luke 12:46, a fate Jesus warns will befall the unfaithful servant). These are not extreme outcomes reserved only for apostates and false brethren; <b>they are real possibilities for any believer who drifts into willful sin and refuses to repent</b>. God’s holiness demands it, and His justice will not bend. <i>“Without holiness... no one will see the Lord”</i> (Hebrews 12:14, NASB).

Therefore, as you begin this book, <b>examine yourself</b> in the light of God’s truth. Are you harboring a sin that you trivialize as <i>“just a struggle”</i> or <i>“just occasional”</i>? Do you subtly believe that being a Christian is a free pass for behavior you know Christ forbids? If so, hear the warning of the Holy Spirit: <i>“Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts”</i> (Hebrews 4:7, NASB). Do not bank on future repentance or greater resolve tomorrow – that is a deadly gamble. God’s word says <i>now</i> is the time to repent, <i>“now is ‘the day of salvation’”[<sup>biblehub.com</sup></i>](https://biblehub.com/nasb/2_corinthians/6-2.htm#:~:text=NASB%201995%20for%20He%20says%2C,THE%20DAY%20OF%20SALVATION)</i>. He is patient, indeed, <i>“not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance”[<sup>nasb.literalword.com</sup></i>](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=2+Peter+3%3A9#:~:text=9%20The%20Lord%20is%20not,all%20to%20come%20to%20repentance)</i>. Yet His patience has a purpose – to lead us to repentance <i>now</i> – and it will <b>not</b> excuse those who spurn it. <i>“Or do you think lightly of the riches of His kindness and tolerance and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?”</i> (Romans 2:4 NASB). The very grace you count on is pleading with you to turn from sin today. There is abundant mercy for the contrite heart, but for the stubborn and unrepentant, <i>“there will be wrath and fury”</i> (Romans 2:5).

In the chapters that follow, we will explore more deeply how and why true believers can forfeit salvation through unrepentant sin, examining the full counsel of Scripture on God’s grace, holiness, and judgment. This is not a theoretical issue – it is <b>eternally practical</b>. As these opening examples show, it is perilously easy to <i>feel</i> saved and secure while living in a way that God says leads to damnation. Our hope is that this book will awaken you to the <b>clear and present danger</b> of willful sin. <i>“Let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall”</i> (1 Corinthians 10:12, NASB). The loving voice of God calls out: <i>Repent!</i> Do not delay. <i>“Today, while you have the opportunity, turn and seek the Lord that He may have mercy”</i> (cf. Isaiah 55:6–7). <b>There may be no tomorrow.</b> <i>“It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God”</i> (Hebrews 10:31, NASB)[<i><sup>nasb.literalword.com</sup></i>](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=Hebrews+10%3A26-39#:~:text=who%20has%20trampled%20under%20foot,hands%20of%20the%20living%20God), but it is a wonderful thing to fall to your knees in humble repentance now, while His arms are still open. May the Spirit of God grant you ears to hear this urgent call. Eternal life is at stake.

# Chapter 2: “Be Not Deceived”: The Bible’s Warnings to Believers
Scripture confronts us with **unmistakable warnings** that a lifestyle of willful sin is incompatible with salvation. Far from offering carnal Christians a free pass, the Word of God repeatedly declares that **those who persist in disobedience will be excluded from God’s kingdom**. In this chapter, we will briefly examine key biblical passages – without intricate commentary – allowing the force of the text to speak plainly. These verses span multiple authors and testaments, yet they form a consistent witness: *only those who **continue in faith and holiness** will finally be saved.* The **flip side** is equally clear: those who *claim* to belong to Christ yet *“practice sin”* will face eternal death unless they repent. As we compile these scriptures (all quotes are from the NASB for clarity), remember that many of them were originally addressed *to Christians*. The apostles did not hesitate to warn believers about the danger of being deceived regarding sin. Let the reader approach these verses with a humble, open heart – perhaps as if hearing them for the first time – and allow the Holy Spirit to apply them personally.
## <a name="_toc197890373"></a>“No Inheritance in the Kingdom” – Warnings from Paul’s Epistles
The Apostle **Paul** makes it painfully clear that certain behaviors, if practiced unrepentantly, bar a person from eternal life. Writing to the **Corinthian** church – which included some who had a background of sexual sin and other vices – Paul warns bluntly:

*“Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God.”[<sup>nasb.literalword.com</sup>*](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=Revelation+21%3A8%2C+Revelation+22%3A12-16#:~:text=8%20But%20for%20the%20cowardly,%E2%80%9D)*

It is difficult to imagine a more straightforward statement. Paul knew that believers might be tempted to **rationalize** ongoing sins (perhaps thinking, “Surely God wouldn’t exclude *us*, we’re saved by grace!”). So he prefaces the vice list by saying *“Do not be deceived.”* In other words, let no one trick you with empty assurances: people who live in these patterns – sexual immorality, false worship, theft and greed, substance abuse, abusive speech, cheating others – **have no inheritance in God’s kingdom**. Paul does not caveat, *“unless they once accepted Christ, in which case they’re safe.”* No – he states a general truth applicable to *anyone*. He then reminds the Corinthians that **true conversion produces a break from such sins**: *“Such were some of you; but you were washed… sanctified… justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ”* (1 Cor 6:11). The Christians at Corinth had been **cleansed and set apart** from those old identities. How unthinkable, then, for any of them to return to those sins and yet presume to **still inherit the kingdom**! The warning stands: a **“Christian” who becomes again a fornicator, drunkard, etc., and persists without repentance, will by no means be saved**. *“Do not be deceived.”*

Paul issues nearly **identical warnings** to other churches. To the **Galatians**, he writes that *“the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit”* (Gal 5:17), and he lists the “deeds of the flesh” as *“immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these.”* Then Paul, the preacher of justification by faith, adds this emphatic conclusion:

*“Of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.” (Galatians 5:19–21)*

Here again, the **inheritance of the kingdom** is conditional: if you *“practice such things”* (live habitually in these sins), you exclude yourself. In fact, Paul says he has warned them of this repeatedly (*“as I have forewarned you”*). Grace does not grant immunity to an impenitent sinner. A professing Christian who persists in *any* of these works of the flesh – whether sexual impurity, idolatry/occult practice, or relational sins like fits of anger and divisiveness – **will forfeit the kingdom of God**. This is a sobering reality. Paul is not afraid it will undermine *sola fide*; rather, he sees it as integral to the gospel call. Those truly justified by faith *also receive the Spirit*, who leads them away from the domination of such sins. *“If we live by the Spirit,”* Paul concludes, *“let us also walk by the Spirit”* (Gal 5:25). Any “faith” that produces only the **works of the flesh** and not the **fruit of the Spirit** (Gal 5:22–23) is no saving faith at all (cf. James 2:17).

In Paul’s letter to the **Ephesians**, we find a similar list and warning. He says *“immorality or any impurity or greed”* must not even be named among saints, and adds:

*“For this you know with certainty, that no immoral or impure person or covetous man, who is an idolater, has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.” (Ephesians 5:5–6)*

Note the phrasing “*with certainty*” – Paul wants zero doubt on this point. Someone whose life is characterized by sexual immorality, impurity (a broader term for uncleanness), or greedy idolatry (essentially, unchecked covetousness/materialism which amounts to worshiping a false god) – **such a person is not going to inherit Christ’s kingdom**. Period. Again he anticipates the **“empty words”** of false teachers who might say otherwise (“God won’t really exclude you; you’re His people!”). Paul insists that those very sins **incur God’s wrath** on the disobedient. How could anyone claiming to be saved take part in what provokes God’s holy anger? *“Do not be partners with them,”* he immediately adds (Eph 5:7). The clear implication is that **if we live like “sons of disobedience,” we will share their fate under wrath**. Our identity must be proven by our deeds; those united to Christ walk in light, not darkness (Eph 5:8).

Thus, three times Paul lists <b>specific sins</b> and plainly states that practitioners of such <b>will not enter heaven</b>. These are not isolated proof-texts but a consistent apostolic teaching, conveyed to multiple churches. We could add that <b>John in Revelation</b> agrees, for he writes that in the New Jerusalem <i>“nothing unclean, and no one who practices abomination and lying, shall ever come into it”</i> (Rev 21:27). Earlier he records that <i>“the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and <b>sexually immoral persons</b> and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars”</i> will have <b>“their part... in the lake that burns with fire... the second death.”[<i><sup>nasb.literalword.com</sup></i>](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=Revelation+21%3A8%2C+Revelation+22%3A12-16#:~:text=8%20But%20for%20the%20cowardly,%E2%80%9D)</b>. The <b>end of the story</b> has the same moral as all these epistles: sin may seem to triumph for a season, but <b>every unrepentant sinner will be barred from God’s glorious kingdom</b> and instead will meet with eternal fire. The apostles and Scripture authors did not soften that reality even when addressing <i>baptized believers</i>. They loved their readers enough to warn them: do not be deceived – a name on a church roll, a past experience, or a mere profession of faith means nothing if you <b>choose a life of unrighteousness</b>. <b>Grace is amazing</b>, but <i>“God is not mocked”</i>: <i>“the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap <b>corruption</b>”</i> (Gal 6:7–8). As Paul told the <b>Romans</b>, <i>“if you are living according to the flesh, <b>you must die</b>; but if by the Spirit you are putting to death the deeds of the body, <b>you will live</b>”</i> (Rom 8:13). <b>Eternal life and death</b> hang in the balance, depending on whether we crucify our flesh or cater to it.
## <a name="_toc197890374"></a>Warnings to Continue: “If We Deny Him…” – Perseverance in the Pastoral Epistles
The New Testament also contains conditional warnings in the form of **“if”** statements, underscoring that continuing in Christ is necessary. For example, Paul teaches Timothy:

*“It is a trustworthy statement: for if we died with Him, we will also live with Him; if we endure, we will also reign with Him; if we deny Him, He also will deny us; if we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.” (2 Timothy 2:11–13)*

This early Christian hymn (as it appears to be) contrasts the outcome of **endurance** versus **denial**. Reigning with Christ is promised **only to those who endure**. By contrast, **if a believer were to deny Christ**, Christ will be faithful to His holiness and **deny that person** – echoing Jesus’ own words: *“Whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father”* (Matt 10:33). It is a sobering possibility. Some interpreters soften 2 Timothy 2:13 (“if we are faithless…”) to refer to occasional lapses, saying Christ still keeps us. But the context strongly implies that **“faithless”** (without faith) is parallel to denying Him – hence a final falling away. Christ remains faithful to His threat in that case: He *cannot deny Himself* or contradict His own Word. Thus, even here, with a positive tone of encouragement (*“let’s endure and live with Him!”*), the **negative warning stands**: *we must not deny our Lord*, whether by word or by persistently disobeying Him as Lord. This warning would certainly apply to those effectively **denying Christ by their deeds** (Titus 1:16). The Apostle John likewise wrote, *“If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, **we lie** and do not practice the truth”* (1 John 1:6). **Talk is cheap**; a lifestyle of disobedience “denies” Christ regardless of our church-talk. But *“let everyone who names the name of the Lord abstain from wickedness”* (2 Tim 2:19).
## <a name="_toc197890375"></a>“Today, If You Hear His Voice…” – Exhortations from Hebrews
Perhaps the **strongest warnings in the New Testament** are found in the Epistle to the **Hebrews**. These were written to professing Christians who were tempted to *“shrink back”* (Heb 10:38) from the costly path of discipleship. The author employs some of the most unsettling language in Scripture to jolt them (and us) to persevere. We will consider two major passages: Hebrews 6 and 10. Keep in mind, these warnings appear *within* a letter that also magnificently teaches Christ’s sufficiency and God’s promises. The presence of these warnings shows that *assurance* and *exhortation* go hand in hand – true believers take heed and thus continue in faith.

**Hebrews 6:4–8** speaks of the dreadful fate of apostasy:

*“For in the case of those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, and then have fallen away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance, since they again crucify to themselves the Son of God and put Him to open shame. For ground that drinks the rain... and yields thorns and thistles, it is worthless and close to being cursed, and it ends up being burned.” (Heb 6:4–8)*

This passage describes people who clearly were within the community of believers – <i>enlightened</i> (baptized and taught), <i>tasted</i> the heavenly gift and the Spirit’s grace, even experiencing the goodness of God’s Word. And yet, shockingly, they later <b>“fall away”</b> (the Greek term <i>parapipto</i>, meaning to commit apostasy). The text soberly states that <b>renewal to repentance becomes impossible</b> for such, because by their willful departure they effectively <b>re-crucify Christ</b> – treating Him with contempt despite having known His grace. This is not describing a momentary lapse or struggle, but a decisive repudiation of Christ’s lordship (whether by explicit renunciation or by hardened, continual disobedience). The <b>imagery of land and rain</b> then drives it home: a field that ought to produce vegetation but instead yields only thorns is about to be cursed and burned[<i><sup>reformedbooksonline.com](https://reformedbooksonline.com/on-the-continuation-of-justification/#:~:text=25,%E2%80%A6)[reformedbooksonline.com</i></sup>](https://reformedbooksonline.com/on-the-continuation-of-justification/#:~:text=27,%E2%80%9D). This clearly alludes to <b>final judgment</b> by fire. In other words, those who <b>turn back decisively from Christ</b> after receiving His truth have no second remedy – they are like barren land destined for burning. While interpretations vary, the <b>plain sense</b> is that a person can come <i>very far</i> in association with Christ – even receive the Spirit’s influences – and yet, by <i>falling away</i>, end up damned with no further opportunity to repent. This utterly demolishes the notion that <i>“once saved, always saved”</i> as a <b>guarantee regardless of behavior</b>. True believers must take this as a <b>warning to persevere</b> and not even flirt with the thought of forsaking Christ for sin.

Equally severe is **Hebrews 10:26–31**, which warns against deliberate, ongoing sin after knowing the gospel:

*“For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a terrifying expectation of judgment and the fury of a fire which will consume the adversaries. Anyone who has set aside the Law of Moses dies without mercy... How much severer punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace? ...‘The Lord will judge His people.’ It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God.” (Hebrews 10:26–31)*

Here the author includes himself with the word “**we**” – *“if we go on sinning willfully…”* – showing this is a real warning to the community of professing believers. To “sin willfully” in context means to **knowingly persist in sin** (any sin, but especially the sin of repudiating Christ), as opposed to stumbling out of weakness. The consequence is dire: *“no sacrifice for sins remains.”* If one spurns Christ’s sacrifice through persistent disobedience, there is **no further remedy** from God – only judgment. By using Old Testament law as a lesser example (where apostates were executed), he argues that **rejecting Christ’s covenant** is even worse, meriting a *“much severer punishment.”* Notice the apostate is described as one who **was sanctified by Christ’s blood** (at least in outward covenant terms) yet later calls that blood “unclean” – as if treating Jesus’ sacrifice as worthless. This person **insults the Spirit of grace** – the very Spirit who testifies to Christ. All this language points to someone who *started as a Christian*, then willfully abandoned holiness and faith. The conclusion leaves us trembling: *God will judge His people* – yes, *His own people* – if they forsake His Son. *“It is a terrifying thing to fall into [His] hands.”*

We must not blunt this edge: **a Christian who “goes on sinning willfully” is on the path to fiery judgment**. Some try to limit Hebrews 10:26 to the “sin” of reverting to Judaism. But verse 26 does not so limit it – *“sinning willfully”* is broad. In truth, any **willful continuation in known sin** is a form of trampling Christ underfoot. When one stubbornly refuses to repent, he treats Christ’s blood lightly, as if it neither cleanses nor deserves his allegiance. Such a person is effectively saying, *“Jesus died for me, but I don’t regard His lordship or holiness – I’ll keep my beloved sin.”* This is an **insult to the Spirit of grace**. The Scripture leaves no room for comfort here: if that pattern persists, **no sacrifice covers those sins**. The only destiny is “fury of fire.” How many in our churches today **“go on sinning willfully”** – whether it be viewing pornography regularly, cheating in business, nursing bitterness, or any number of habitual sins – all the while assuming grace will cover it? The Word of God says otherwise: such persons should expect *judgment, not mercy*, unless they repent. These are not our words but God’s. It is *loving* to press this truth on any who are toying with damnation through cherished sin.

Hebrews also echoes earlier the warning from Psalm 95: *“Today if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts”* (Heb 3:7). The writer exhorts believers to *“encourage one another day after day… so that none of you will be **hardened by the deceitfulness of sin**”* (Heb 3:13). Sin is **treacherous** – it lies to us, gradually hardening our conscience until repentance becomes humanly impossible. Thus, even apart from final apostasy, there is the very real danger of a **Christian’s heart growing hard** and unbelieving, leading them to fall away: *“Take care, brethren, that there not be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart **that falls away from the living God**”* (Heb 3:12). Notice he addresses them as “brethren” yet warns of departing from God – showing again that the threat is real, not hypothetical. The only safeguard is to respond to God **today**, in the moment of conviction – not to delay repentance. One who continually **hardens himself** may cross a line where he cannot soften again. The example given is the Israelites who perished in the wilderness: *“And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest, but to those who were **disobedient**? So we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief”* (Heb 3:18–19). Disobedience and unbelief are two sides of the same coin. If we persist in disobedience, we show an evil heart of unbelief and may forfeit the eternal “rest” promised to God’s people.
## <a name="_toc197890376"></a>“No One Born of God Sins” – The Test of 1 John
We turn now to the Apostle **John**, whose first epistle addresses the marks of a true Christian. John’s letter is full of assurances of God’s love and grace, yet it also contains **uncompromising tests of obedience**. Contrary to the false teachers of his day (and ours), John insists that *continuance in sin* is incompatible with being a child of God. Consider these piercing words:

*“No one who abides in Him sins; no one who sins has seen Him or knows Him. Little children, make sure no one deceives you; the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous; the one who practices sin is of the devil… No one who is born of God practices sin, because His seed abides in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. By this the children of God and the children of the devil are obvious: anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor the one who does not love his brother.” (1 John 3:6–10)*

Here again we see the *“make sure no one deceives you”* caution. Evidently, even in the first-century church some were claiming one could *know God* while living in sin. John will have none of it. To *“sin”* in this passage means to **live in ongoing, unrepented sin** (present tense Greek verbs indicate continuous action). John is not saying a Christian never commits an act of sin (indeed, he earlier says *“if we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves”* – 1 John 1:8). Rather, he’s drawing a line between a life characterized by **practicing sin** versus **practicing righteousness**. The difference is stark and “obvious,” as he says. If someone’s life is a continuous pattern of sin – obeying sinful desires as a rule – that person “belongs to the devil,” regardless of what they profess. They *“have not seen or known”* Christ in truth (v.6). Conversely, the one **truly born again** has God’s “seed” (life) in him, which keeps him from surrendering to sin’s power. There will be an overall pattern of righteousness, however imperfectly.

John’s emphasis is that **saving fellowship with God transforms one’s behavior**. Any “Christian” who is *indistinguishable from a child of the devil* in conduct **is in fact a child of the devil**. Strong words! But necessary. John lovingly addresses the readers as “little children,” reinforcing that this truth guards them from deception. It parallels Paul’s *“do not be deceived”* and Hebrews’ warnings. We cannot claim to be justified by Christ if we make peace with what **Christ died to destroy** (the works of the devil, v.8). Earlier in the epistle, John put it succinctly: *“By this we know that we have come to know Him, **if we keep His commandments**. The one who says ‘I have come to know Him’ and does not keep His commandments **is a liar**, and the truth is not in him”* (1 John 2:3–4). Again, the **identity** (knowing God) is verified by the **habit of obedience**. If a person habitually breaks Christ’s commands, their claim to know Him is false – they are lying, perhaps even to themselves.

What commandments does John have in mind? Primarily the commands to **believe in Christ and to love one another** (1 John 3:23). But also all that Christ and His apostles taught, which certainly includes moral purity. John specifically mentions *“the one who does not love his brother”* is not of God (3:10), and he later adds that *“no murderer has eternal life abiding in him”* (3:15) and *“if someone says ‘I love God’ and hates his brother, he is a liar”* (4:20). These are further examples of the principle: **a real relationship with God is incompatible with a life of hatred, murder, or any such darkness**. Similarly, Revelation 21:8 (which we cited earlier) listed “all liars” and the sexually immoral as having their part in the lake of fire – showing that **living in falsehood or immorality is utterly irreconcilable with being saved**.

Returning to **sexual sin in particular** (the focus of our book): Jesus taught that lusting after a woman in one’s heart is akin to adultery (Matt 5:27–28). A Christian man who persists in consuming pornography is thus *practicing adultery in heart* repeatedly. Can a man do this and truly *“abide in Christ”* at the same time? John’s answer would be *no*. If one *“makes a practice”* of sexual immorality, that person cannot simultaneously claim to be *“born of God”*. Paul told the **Thessalonians**, *“this is the will of God, your sanctification; that is, that you **abstain from sexual immorality**”* (1 Thess 4:3). He then warned that *“the Lord is an avenger in all these things... because God has not called us for the purpose of impurity”* (4:6–7). To *continue* willfully in sexual impurity is to defy the very purpose of God’s calling and to put oneself in line for God’s avenging judgment. John would categorize such a one not as a struggling Christian, but as *“not of God”* if there is no repentance. This is not to discourage someone who *is* fighting and repenting daily – rather, it is to **expose the lie** of the person who says, *“I’m a Christian”* but has **settled into** a pattern of porn use, adultery, or any sin without genuine striving for holiness. Scripture says that claim of knowing God is *null and void*.
## <a name="_toc197890377"></a>“He Who Overcomes… ” – Only the Victorious Inherit the Promises
A final thread in Scripture’s warning tapestry is the repeated call to **overcome or persevere**. In the Book of **Revelation**, Jesus dictates letters to seven churches (Revelation chapters 2–3). Each letter contains promises *“to him who overcomes.”* For example:

*“He who overcomes, and he who keeps My deeds **until the end**, to him I will give authority over the nations” (Rev 2:26).*

*“Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life… He who overcomes will not be hurt by the second death.” (Rev 2:10–11).*

*“He who overcomes will thus be clothed in white garments; and I will not erase his name from the book of life” (Rev 3:5).*

*“He who overcomes, I will grant to him to sit down with Me on My throne, as I also overcame” (Rev 3:21).*

In the <b>final chapter of Scripture</b>, Jesus says: <i>“He who overcomes will inherit these things, and I will be his God and he will be My son. <b>But for the cowardly and unbelieving and… all liars, their part will be in the lake that burns with fire</b>”</i> (Rev 21:7–8)[<i><sup>nasb.literalword.com</sup></i>](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=Revelation+21%3A8%2C+Revelation+22%3A12-16#:~:text=8%20But%20for%20the%20cowardly,%E2%80%9D). We see here a <b>divide</b>: the overcomers versus the faithless. To overcome means to hold fast to Christ by faith, evidenced in faithfulness and repentance, even amidst trials or temptations. It does <i>not</i> mean sinless perfection, but it does mean <i>persevering resistance</i> to the world, flesh, and devil by Christ’s power. Jesus implicitly defines overcoming in Rev 2:26 as <i>“keeping My deeds until the end.”</i> Note that: the overcomer is one who <i>obeys Christ’s works to the end</i>.

Thus, all the blessed promises of eternal life, divine sonship, ruling with Christ, etc., are reserved **for those who endure and overcome**. Conversely, those who **shrink back, give up, or live in cowardly unbelief** will *not* inherit, but face the second death (Rev 21:8). This is perfectly consistent with everything we’ve seen. *“By your endurance you will gain your lives,”* Jesus taught (Luke 21:19). And *“the one who endures to the end, he will be saved”* (Matt 24:13). These statements were given to disciples in contexts of persecution, but they apply broadly: **only a faith that endures to the finish is true faith**. A “faith” that gets choked out by lust or worldliness and does not *finish* the race will not save (cf. the parable of the soils, Luke 8:13–14). Paul likened the Christian life to a boxing match or a race, saying *“I discipline my body and make it my slave, so that, after I have preached to others, **I myself will not be disqualified**”* (1 Cor 9:27). Even the apostle recognized that *he* had to persevere in holiness, lest he be disqualified (rejected) in the end. How much more should we take heed!

Before moving on, let us dispel a misunderstanding: **None of these scriptures teach salvation by our own works or merits**. Rather, they teach the **necessity of holiness as the fruit of genuine faith**. Believers are saved by grace through faith in Christ, *“not as a result of works”* (Eph 2:8–9). *But* the next verse says *“we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus **for good works**, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them”* (Eph 2:10). A true convert will have a life marked by those good works. If those works are utterly absent – if instead one’s “walk” is characterized by the **works of the flesh** – it indicates the person has not been savingly united to Christ. Thus, the warnings serve to shake false professors out of their deception and to spur true believers onward in fear and trembling. Far from contradicting grace, these exhortations **are grace** – God’s means to keep us clinging to Christ. When Paul told the Romans *“if you live according to the flesh you must die,”* he immediately added *“but if by the Spirit you are putting to death the deeds of the body, you will live”* (Rom 8:13). In other words, **God’s Spirit empowers the Christian to *kill sin*** – and *that* is the path of life. Indeed, *“if we walk by the Spirit, we will not carry out the desire of the flesh”* (Gal 5:16). The true believer **has access to power** to overcome. The false believer complacently *“lives according to the flesh,”* perhaps citing *“grace”* while doing so, and thus proves he doesn’t have the Spirit (Rom 8:9) – unless he repents and seeks God’s mercy for transformation.

Let us summarize the biblical testimony in plain terms: <b>Professing Christians who practice sexual immorality (such as viewing pornography habitually), drunkenness, hatred, deceit, or any other willful sin, are on course for damnation, not salvation.</b> They <b>must not comfort themselves with false assurances</b>. The Word of God commands such people to <i>repent</i> or perish. As Paul succinctly said, <i>“If we deny Him, He will also deny us”[<sup>goodreads.com</sup></i>](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/963394-mortification-of-sin-in-believers-the-necessity-nature-and-means-of-it#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDo%20you%20mortify%3B%20do%20you,%E2%80%9D)</i>. And <i>“Do not be deceived… no sexually immoral persons… will inherit the Kingdom of God”[<sup>nasb.literalword.com</sup></i>](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=Revelation+21%3A8%2C+Revelation+22%3A12-16#:~:text=8%20But%20for%20the%20cowardly,%E2%80%9D)</i>. On the positive side, <b>if we confess and forsake our sins, trusting in Christ, He is ready to forgive and cleanse us</b> (1 John 1:9). There is abundant pardon for the penitent. But the pardon is never given <i>to those who determine to cling to their sin</i>. Jesus asked, <i>“Why do you call Me ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?”</i> (Luke 6:46). That haunting question should compel each of us to examine ourselves. If you call Jesus “Lord” but continue to <i>serve lust and self</i>, you are deceiving yourself. You cannot have both Christ and your sin. <i>“You cannot serve two masters”</i> (Matt 6:24). <b>Choose this day whom you will serve.</b> The next chapters will show that this exact message – that only those who persist in obedience will be saved, and that Christians living in gross sin will face hell – has been the consistent teaching of faithful Christians throughout history.

Before proceeding, hear one more plea from Scripture itself, one that beautifully balances warning and hope:

*“Pursue peace with all men, and the holiness without which no one will see the Lord. See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God… that there be no immoral or godless person like Esau, who sold his own birthright for a single meal. For you know that even afterwards, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought for it with tears.” (Hebrews 12:14–17)*

Holiness is absolutely necessary to see the Lord – there are no exceptions. And the window of repentance can close if one sells Christ for a moment of sin and later tries to reclaim the blessing. Do not be like Esau. If you have been **trading away your heavenly birthright** for the bitter pleasure of pornography (or any sin), *stop now and weep for your soul*. Seek the Lord while He may be found. *Today* is the day of salvation. The *grace of God* is mighty to forgive and renew – but **it is only found on the path of repentance**. Turn, forsake your sin, and run to Christ in obedient faith. Otherwise, the fury of fire waits to consume the adversaries. These are not our words; they are God’s. We implore you to heed them.

# Chapter 3: Voices of the Early Church (1st–4th Century) on Sin and Apostasy
How did the earliest Christians – those closest in time to the apostles – understand the relationship between *baptism, post-conversion sin, and salvation*? Did they teach *“once saved, always saved”* regardless of one’s lifestyle? Did they minimize the threat of **apostasy** (falling away) for believers? The historical record is clear: the early church overwhelmingly believed that **after baptism, a believer must continue in holiness, and that serious sin could indeed put one’s salvation in jeopardy**. They stressed **vigilance and repentance**, warning that those who **turn back to a life of sin face damnation** unless they repent. In this chapter, we will survey a range of early Christian writings from the **1st through 4th centuries** – including *the Didache*, *The Shepherd of Hermas*, *Clement of Rome*, *Ignatius of Antioch*, *Cyprian of Carthage*, *John Chrysostom*, and *Augustine of Hippo*. Despite differences in era and context, we will see a common theme: these early Christian teachers echo the New Testament in insisting that **nominal Christians living in sin will not be saved**. Some even speak of a point of *no return* for those who willfully persist in sin. This historical witness should challenge the modern church to recover a **healthy fear of God** and an emphasis on *perseverance in righteousness*.

Before we begin, it is worth noting that the early church faced real scenarios of baptized believers committing grave sins (like idolatry, sexual immorality, or denying the faith under persecution). Their responses are **pastorally rich**: they upheld God’s mercy for the truly penitent, yet they by no means offered *unconditional security* to the unrepentant. They took Jesus’ and the apostles’ warnings at face value. In doing so, they refuted both the **legalism** of never allowing restoration (as some extreme sects did) and the **antinomianism** of cheap grace. Let us listen to these voices in roughly chronological order.
## <a name="_toc197890379"></a>The Didache – Two Ways: Life or Death, Holiness or Destruction
One of the earliest Christian documents after the New Testament is the **Didache** (late 1st century, also called “The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles”). It served as a sort of church manual for early Christian communities. The Didache opens with a memorable description of **two ways**: the way of life and the way of death. It leaves no doubt that **sinful conduct leads to damnation, whereas obedience leads to life**:

*“There are two ways, one of life and one of death; but a great difference between the two ways… The way of life … is this: First, you shall love God who made you; second, love your neighbor as yourself… And the second commandment of the Teaching; You shall not commit murder, you shall not commit adultery... you shall not commit fornication, you shall not steal... you shall not practice magic, you shall not practice witchcraft... you shall not covet...\* My child, flee from every evil thing, and from every likeness of it…”\*\*[<sup>newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0714.htm#:~:text=And%20the%20second%20commandment%20of,tongued%3B%20for)[newadvent.org*</sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0714.htm#:~:text=empty%2C%20but%20fulfilled%20by%20deed,more%20than%20your%20own%20life)*

After enumerating many sins to avoid (including sexual sins, occult practices, and attitudes like double-mindedness and pride), the Didache then describes:

*“ The way of death is this: First of all it is evil and full of curse: murders, adulteries, lusts, fornications, thefts, idolatries... deceit, haughtiness... [those who do these things are] utter sinners. Be delivered, children, from all these.”\*\*[<sup>newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0714.htm#:~:text=And%20the%20way%20of%20death,pitying%20a%20poor%20man%2C%20not)[newadvent.org*</sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0714.htm#:~:text=labouring%20for%20the%20afflicted%2C%20not,delivered%2C%20children%2C%20from%20all%20these)*

The stark contrast is evident. The <i>“way of life”</i> involves <b>obeying God’s commandments</b>, practicing love and purity. The <i>“way of death”</i> is characterized by the very sins listed. And the readers (“children”) are urged to <b>keep free</b> from all those vices. The Didache doesn’t explicitly use the terms <i>heaven</i> and <i>hell</i> here, but <i>“way of death”</i> clearly implies <b>final destruction</b>. If one walks in those sins, one is on the road to <b>death</b> (spiritual death and exclusion from life). The implication is that <b>baptized Christians must continue living by the way of life</b>. In fact, later the Didache instructs that before baptism, the catechumens must learn all these commands and commit to following <i>“the yoke of the Lord”</i> (Didache 6). It even says, <i>“If you are able to bear the entire yoke of the Lord, you will be perfect; but if you are not able, do what you can”[<sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0714.htm#:~:text=Chapter%206,and%20Food%20Offered%20to%20Idols)</i> – indicating that strenuous obedience is expected, even if one grows into full maturity over time.

What’s crucial is that the earliest post-New Testament writing presents the Christian life in **binary terms**: either you pursue the path of holiness (leading to eternal life), or you follow sin (leading to death). There is no third category of “carnal Christian who will still slide into heaven.” If some modern teachers imply that one can live like those on the “way of death” yet still have eternal life because of a one-time decision, the **Didache’s authors would vehemently disagree**. They inherited from the apostles the understanding that **continuance in gross sin is a soul-destroying path**. *“Be delivered... from all these,”* they plead. We see no hint that they would console a person living in adultery or lust with *“Don’t worry, you prayed the sinner’s prayer.”* Rather, they would say, *“Flee from those sins or you will perish on the way of death!”* The Didache shows the **pastoral balancing act**: it’s straightforward about moral demands, yet also merciful (e.g., it urges gentleness and patience with those who can only partially bear the load). But never does it **minimize the gravity of sin** or suggest that an immoral Christian is safe.
## <a name="_toc197890380"></a>Clement of Rome – “Abandon Evil Desires that We May Be Sheltered from Judgments”
Moving to the late 1st century, we have a letter known as **1 Clement**, traditionally ascribed to *Clement of Rome* (c. AD 96), written to the Corinthian church. Clement was concerned with a schism in Corinth, but along the way, he exhorts the believers to **repent of envy and strife** and pursue humility and obedience. Clement clearly believes that **fearing God and maintaining good works are necessary to avoid God’s judgment**. For example:

*“Since, therefore, all things are seen and heard by Him, let us fear Him and abandon the filthy desires for evil deeds, that we may be sheltered by His mercy from the judgments to come.”[<sup>earlychristianwritings.com](https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/1clement-hoole.html#:~:text=CHAPTER%2028)[earlychristianwritings.com*</sup>](https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/1clement-hoole.html#:~:text=28%3A1%20Since%2C%20therefore%2C%20all%20things,from%20the%20judgments%20to%20come)*

Here Clement urges the church to <i>fear God</i>, turn away from any <i>“filthy desires”</i> and sinful deeds, precisely so that they may obtain mercy and not condemnation in the coming Judgment. This echoes the New Testament call to <i>cleanse ourselves from defilement out of fear of God</i> (2 Cor 7:1). Clement doesn’t take it for granted that all in the church will automatically escape judgment; rather, <b>they must persevere in holiness to find mercy</b>. If some in Corinth were harboring envy or rebellion (as the letter indicates), Clement warns that failing to repent would put them in grave danger: <i>“we shall incur no slight harm, but rather great danger, if we… estrange us from that which is good”</i> he writes[<i><sup>earlychristianwritings.com](https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/1clement-hoole.html#:~:text=14%3A1%20It%20is%20therefore%20meet,are%20leaders%20of%20detestable%20sedition)[earlychristianwritings.com</i></sup>](https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/1clement-hoole.html#:~:text=14%3A2%20For%20we%20shall%20incur,from%20that%20which%20is%20good).

Clement also emphasizes that being God’s people entails **living up to that calling**. He reminds them:

*“Let us, therefore, approach Him with holiness of spirit, lifting unto Him pure and undefiled hands… Since, therefore, we are a portion of the Holy One, let us do all such things as pertain to holiness, avoiding evil-speaking, foul and impure embraces, drunkenness, disorderliness, abominable desires, detestable adultery… justified by our deeds, and not by our words.”[<sup>earlychristianwritings.com](https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/1clement-hoole.html#:~:text=29%3A1%20Let%20us%2C%20therefore%2C%20approach,a%20part%20of%20his%20elect)[earlychristianwritings.com*</sup>](https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/1clement-hoole.html#:~:text=30%3A1%20Since%2C%20therefore%2C%20we%20are,desires%2C%20detestable%20adultery%2C%20execrable%20pride)*

Observe several things in this exhortation. Clement bases ethical living on identity: <i>“we are a portion of the Holy One”</i> (God’s people), therefore we must <i>“do all things that pertain to holiness.”</i> He then explicitly lists <i>avoiding</i> things like foul embraces (likely sexual sin), <b>drunkenness</b>, <b>lust (“abominable desires”), and adultery</b>, among others. If members of the church were engaging in any of those, Clement’s instruction is to <b>stop</b> – holiness admits no such practices. Strikingly, he says we are <i>“justified by our deeds, and not by our words.”</i> This is not a denial of justification by faith; rather, in context, Clement means that our <b>true righteousness is demonstrated in actions, not in mere talk[<i><sup>earlychristianwritings.com](https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/1clement-hoole.html#:~:text=30%3A2%20for%20God%2C%20he%20saith%2C,giveth%20grace%20unto%20the%20humble)[earlychristianwritings.com</i></sup>](https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/1clement-hoole.html#:~:text=30%3A3%20Let%20us%20cleave%2C%20therefore%2C,and%20not%20by%20our%20words)</b>. It’s akin to James saying <i>“I will show you my faith by my works”</i> (James 2:18). Many might <i>claim</i> to be righteous (the Corinthian schismatics likely claimed to be in the right), but Clement reminds them that <b>God’s verdict (“justified”) in the end will accord with how we actually lived</b>. If our <i>deeds</i> are wicked, no mere <i>words</i> or affiliations will save us. This implies that a person calling himself a Christian yet living in “detestable adultery” or the like will <b>not be acquitted</b> in the judgment – regardless of any claims.

1 Clement also alludes to Scripture examples of those who sinned and were punished (like the Israelites). He takes these as warnings. For instance, he cites <i>“God’s declaration: ‘If they shall forsake My law… I will visit their offenses with a rod’”[<sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L151%20such%20as,a%20rod%2C%20and%20their%20sins)</i> – indicating that even God’s chosen ones (Israel) did not escape punishment if they forsook His commands. The implication for the church is that <b>we too will face God’s rod if we turn from His way</b>. Clement specifically states, <i>“We should fear the Lord and keep His commandments, lest we fall away like the wilderness generation.”</i> The letter frequently calls for <b>repentance</b> and a return to peace, humility, and obedience so that they may all the more <i>“partake in God’s promises.”</i> Clearly, Clement does not teach an unconditional security where behavior is irrelevant. Rather, he exhorts to <i>“clothe ourselves in concord, being humble and self-controlled… living in the fear of God”</i> – because only in this way will they remain in God’s favor. In summary, Clement of Rome’s letter shows an expectation that <b>Christians must continue in faithfulness and moral purity</b>, or else they will face <i>“great danger”[<sup>earlychristianwritings.com</sup></i>](https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/1clement-hoole.html#:~:text=14%3A1%20It%20is%20therefore%20meet,are%20leaders%20of%20detestable%20sedition)</i> of judgment.
## <a name="_toc197890381"></a>Ignatius of Antioch – “Do Not Be Deceived”: No Room for Persisting in Sin or Heresy
Moving into the early 2nd century, we consider **Ignatius of Antioch** (died c. 107 AD). Ignatius was a bishop who wrote several letters to churches on his way to martyrdom. In them, he passionately urges believers to **cling to Christ, unity, and sound doctrine** – and he *denounces false teachers and immoral influences*. In his epistle to the **Ephesians**, Ignatius echoes Paul’s warning almost verbatim and even extends it. He writes:

*“Do not err, my brethren. … Those that corrupt families shall not inherit the kingdom of God[<sup>newadvent.org</sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0104.htm#:~:text=Do%20not%20err%20%2C%20my,one%20that%20hearkens%20unto%20him). If, then, those who do this as respects the flesh have suffered death, how much more shall this be the case with anyone who corrupts by wicked doctrine the faith of God… Such a one, becoming defiled, shall go away into everlasting fire, and so shall everyone that hearkens unto him.”[<sup>newadvent.org</sup>*](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0104.htm#:~:text=Do%20not%20err%20%2C%20my,one%20that%20hearkens%20unto%20him)*

Ignatius first quotes what appears to be a known saying (likely based on 1 Cor 6:9–10): <i>“Those that corrupt families shall not inherit the kingdom”[<sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0104.htm#:~:text=Do%20not%20err%20%2C%20my,one%20that%20hearkens%20unto%20him)</i>. This phrase <i>“corrupt families”</i> probably refers to sexual immorality (some translate it “adulterers”). It’s essentially listing a class of sinners who will be excluded from God’s kingdom. Ignatius takes that accepted truth – that an immoral person (one breaking up families, perhaps through adultery or sexual sin) <b>will not inherit heaven</b> – and then makes a <b>fortiori</b> argument: if <i>that</i> is true in the realm of immoral behavior, <b>“how much more”</b> will a person who corrupts others with heretical teaching be damned. <i>Such a one</i>, Ignatius says, <i>goes to everlasting fire[<sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0104.htm#:~:text=then%2C%20those%20who%20do%20this,away%20into%20everlasting%20fire%2C%20and)</i>. And not only the false teacher, but <i>“everyone that hearkens to him”</i> – i.e., those led into apostasy by listening to false doctrine. Notice, he puts <b>persistent sexual sin and persistent doctrinal apostasy</b> in a similar category: both lead to exclusion from the kingdom and eternal fire. He also uses <i>“Do not err”</i> (same as “do not be deceived”) to preface this warning[<i><sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0104.htm#:~:text=Do%20not%20err%20%2C%20my,one%20that%20hearkens%20unto%20him), showing that he, like Paul and John, worries that believers might be fooled into thinking differently. Ignatius evidently wants the Ephesians to grasp that <b>Christian profession means nothing if one becomes an adulterer or a promoter of falsehood – the end is hell</b>.

In another letter, to the <b>Philadelphians</b>, Ignatius similarly warns against schismatics and those who depart from the bishop. He says: <i>“If anyone follows him that makes a schism, <b>he shall not inherit the kingdom of God</b>”[<sup>biblehub.com</sup></i>](https://biblehub.com/library/ignatius/the_epistle_of_ignatius_to_the_philadelphians/chapter_iii_avoid_schismatics.htm#:~:text=Avoid%20Schismatics.%20,893%5D%20opinion%2C%20he)</i>. Again, we hear the echo of Paul’s “will not inherit” warning, applied here to divisive persons. Ignatius is consistent: <b>certain behaviors put one outside salvation’s path</b> – whether sexual sin, divisiveness, or doctrinal deviance. Faith in Christ, to Ignatius, cannot be separated from <b>submission to Christ’s truth and love in the community</b>. Those who abandon that for sin or error are no longer on track to the kingdom.

Ignatius also stresses **obedience**. He tells the **Trallians**: *“**Be not deceived**… no one professing faith sins; nor does anyone possessing love hate his brother”* (Trallians 6). And to the **Magnesians** he writes, *“**It is absurd to profess Christ Jesus, and to practice Judaism**”* (Magnesians 10) – meaning one’s behavior must match one’s confession. The consistent message: *Don’t kid yourself.* If someone *“professes faith”* yet “sins” (by which he means lives in sin), he’s deceived. If someone claims to love God but hates others, he’s lying. Ignatius clearly saw **moral and practical proof** as essential to genuine Christianity.

So in Ignatius, just a decade or so after the apostle John’s death, we see the same line drawn: <b>persisting in sin or heresy leads to damnation, regardless of one’s claim to Christianity</b>. Far from giving people an unconditional security, Ignatius urges them to <i>persevere in unity, sound doctrine, and holiness.</i> He even says in one place: <i>“For this cause did the Lord suffer the ointment to be poured on His head, that He might breathe immortality into His Church. <b>Be not anointed with the ill odor of the prince of this world</b>”</i> (Eph. 17) – a poetic way to say: Christ gave us the fragrance of life; don’t let Satan’s foul odor (sin, lies) stain you. <i>“Why do we foolishly perish,”</i> he asks, <i>“not recognizing the gift of God?”[<sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0104.htm#:~:text=Chapter%2017,doctrines)</i>. In Ignatius’s view, a Christian who turns to the world’s lies is <i>foolishly perishing</i> – throwing away the gift of salvation. This is a powerful witness that the early sub-apostolic church saw <b>salvation as conditional upon persevering in truth and love</b>.
## <a name="_toc197890382"></a>The Shepherd of Hermas – Limited Second Repentance and the Peril of Post-Baptismal Sin
One of the most illuminating early texts on this subject is **The Shepherd of Hermas** (mid-2nd century). *Hermas* is an allegorical work recording visions and teachings given to a man named Hermas. Its central concern is the **moral purity of Christians and the possibility of repentance after sin**. Hermas reflects the struggle of the early church to balance God’s mercy with the seriousness of sin *after baptism*. At times, Hermas was so strict that later Christians debated its meaning. But one passage stands out for its **urgency about not delaying repentance**:

*“The Lord has sworn by His glory, in regard to His elect, that if any one of them sin after a certain day which has been fixed, he shall not be saved. For the repentance of the righteous has limits. Filled up are the days of repentance to all the saints; but to the heathen, repentance will be possible even to the last day.”[<sup>newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/02011.htm#:~:text=day%2C%20if%20they%20repent%20with,promises%20with%20great%20%2044)[newadvent.org*</sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/02011.htm#:~:text=elect%2C%20that%20if%20any%20one,to%20direct%20their%20ways%20in)*

This is an astonishing statement. Hermas claims a revelation that God set a <i>deadline</i> for His people to repent. Essentially, he’s saying: <i>God gave the Church a limited time window (“a certain day”) by which the elect needed to turn from sins; beyond that, any who continue sinning will not be saved.</i> He explicitly says <i>“the repentance of the righteous has limits,”</i> and that for Christians (<i>“saints”</i>) the allotted days of repentance have been completed[<i><sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/02011.htm#:~:text=day%2C%20if%20they%20repent%20with,promises%20with%20great%20%2044). In contrast, non-Christians (“heathen”) still have until the final judgment to find repentance (presumably through conversion).

Scholars interpret this in context of a crisis in the early church: many believers had fallen into grave sins (like denying Christ under persecution, or sexual immorality), and the church wrestled with whether to readmit them if they repent. Hermas seems to indicate that <b>God in His mercy allowed one single post-baptismal repentance</b> – a sort of extraordinary grace period – but warns that believers must not presume they can sin with impunity repeatedly. <i>“If any one of them sins after [that fixed day], he shall not be saved.”[<sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/02011.htm#:~:text=day%2C%20if%20they%20repent%20with,promises%20with%20great%20%2044)</i> This suggests that <b>continued willful sin can exhaust one’s opportunity to repent</b>. Hermas pictures a scenario where <b>grace’s door can shut</b> on a Christian who keeps abusing it. The theology here is admittedly peculiar (later Church would allow that sincere repentance is always possible if one lives). But the thrust is clear: <b>Don’t delay repentance, and don’t assume you can always come back later.</b> There may come a time when <b>repentance is no longer granted</b> to the hardhearted. This aligns with Hebrews 6: <i>“it is impossible to renew them again to repentance”</i> if they fall away.

Hermas repeatedly urges righteousness. In Vision 3, he sees a tower being built (symbolizing the Church), and some stones are rejected due to sins; he’s told they can be purified if they repent quickly, but if not, they may not enter the tower. At one point, Hermas asks if certain grievous sins of believers can be forgiven, and the angel (the Shepherd) essentially says *yes, if done once; but continual betrayal of God is deadly.* The Shepherd says: *“You have sinned greatly, yet not for your own sake only was this allowed, but that you might admonish others not to do wickedly... But if, after this, you sin and are not converted... you shall be punished.”* Hermas thus advocates **one time of post-conversion repentance** – after that, one who **returns to sin is in peril of damnation**.

Even if one doesn’t accept Hermas’ idea of a fixed deadline in a literal sense, the <b>pastoral warning is profound</b>: <i>The righteous cannot assume indefinite time to repent.</i> God may withdraw the grace of repentance if we persistently spurn it. Therefore, Hermas urges believers to <b>stop procrastinating and purify their lives immediately</b>. He vividly describes believers who <i>“add to their sins and walk in lusts”</i> as “defiling the name of the Lord” – those individuals, he warns, will <b>lose salvation if they do not cease[<i><sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/02011.htm#:~:text=day%2C%20if%20they%20repent%20with,promises%20with%20great%20%2044)</b>. This is entirely in line with our thesis: Christians who <i>continue</i> in deliberate sin will not be saved. Hermas would say – they might not even get the chance to say “sorry” at the end, because their hearts will be too hardened or the allowance for their repentance may have passed.

For example, in one parable Hermas describes some virgins (symbolizing virtues) who will abandon a man if he strays, and won’t return unless he really repents; if he waits too long, they won’t return at all. It’s an allegory of how virtues (and by extension, salvation) can be lost by negligence. In another section, Hermas is told: *“Only those who fear God and keep His commandments have life with God; but as for those who do not keep His commandments, there is no life in them.”* That straightforwardly equates **obedience with life**; disobedience with spiritual death – again echoing Scripture.

Overall, <i>The Shepherd of Hermas</i> delivered a wake-up call to an early 2nd-century church that may have grown slack: <b>God is holy, and He requires holiness from His people. If they fall into serious sin, they have a narrow window to repent and purify themselves; otherwise, they will perish.</b> This reflects the intense seriousness with which the early church viewed <i>post-baptismal sin</i>. It was not shrugged off under “grace” – it was seen as a <i>threat to one’s salvation</i> unless remedied by genuine, often tearful, repentance. Hermas even has the angel say he asked God to allow <i>this one time</i> of repentance for the lapsed, indicating it was an exceptional mercy. The text explicitly rejects the idea that one can keep oscillating between sin and repentance endlessly. In modern terms, Hermas would absolutely reject the notion of a habitual porn-user casually saying, <i>“Well, I’ll repent later; God will always take me back.”</i> Hermas would thunder: <i>“The repentance of the righteous has limits!”[<sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/02011.htm#:~:text=day%2C%20if%20they%20repent%20with,promises%20with%20great%20%2044)</i>. There may <i>come a point</i> where later never comes. So again: <b>Repent now and utterly, or risk being lost.</b>
## <a name="_toc197890383"></a>Cyprian of Carthage – The Lapsed, Presumption, and the Need for Penitence
Jumping to the 3rd century, **Cyprian of Carthage** (c. AD 250) was a bishop who shepherded his church through intense persecutions and the subsequent crisis of the *lapsed* – those who denied Christ or compromised under persecution. After the persecution eased, many of the lapsed desired to return to the church. Cyprian’s writings (especially *On the Lapsed* and *On the Unity of the Church*) reveal his view that **apostasy and serious sin put one’s soul in dire peril, and only through sincere, often lengthy repentance could they be restored – if at all**. He battled two extremes: the rigorists (Novatian) who said there is *no* forgiveness for serious post-baptismal sin, and the laxists who would readmit the lapsed too easily. Cyprian steers a middle course of **stern but hopeful penance**.

In <b>On the Lapsed</b>, Cyprian vividly describes how some Christians fell – many sacrificed to idols to save their lives, a grave sin of apostasy. He calls their sin <b>adultery against God</b> and warns that <i>even martyrdom later could barely suffice to atone for it[<sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050701.htm#:~:text=Advent%20www,of%20the%20kingdom%3B%20while)</i>. His tone is urgent: <i>“Let no one cheat himself, let no one deceive himself. The Lord alone can have mercy...</i>* those who have done this (lapsed) must engage in full repentance**.”*[<i><sup>newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=,Revelation%202%3A5)[newadvent.org</i></sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=17,sins%20which%20have%20been%20committed). He condemns those lapsed ones who were <b>“obstinate”</b> after their sin – some, after escaping death, went right back to worldly business without contrition[<i><sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=pleasure%20in%20unrighteousness.,unbelievers%2C%20they%20take%20hold%20of). He says such people <i>“despise the Lord’s precepts, neglect the remedy for their wound, and will not repent… When they ought to prostrate themselves to God, they think they stand fast. They have taken peace for themselves when nobody granted it… seduced by false promises… Thus, while by the rashness of some a <b>false safety</b> is either promised or trusted, the hope of <b>true safety</b> is taken away.”[<sup>newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=pleasure%20in%20unrighteousness.,unbelievers%2C%20they%20take%20hold%20of)[newadvent.org</i></sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=persuasion%20kills%20worse%20than%20persecution,62%20safety%20is%20taken%20away)</i>. This is a remarkable line: some pastors in Cyprian’s time were too lenient, <i>“promising”</i> God’s forgiveness prematurely (perhaps influenced by confessors who gave lapsed people immediate absolution). Cyprian calls that a <i>false safety</i> which robs the sinner of <b>true safety</b> by preventing proper repentance[<i><sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=persuasion%20kills%20worse%20than%20persecution,62%20safety%20is%20taken%20away). In other words, telling someone “Don’t worry, you’re forgiven, all is well” when they haven’t fully repented is actually cruel – it may <b>lock them in a state of damnation</b> by removing urgency to change[<i><sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=persuasion%20kills%20worse%20than%20persecution,62%20safety%20is%20taken%20away). Apply that today: telling a porn-addicted believer, “Hey, we all struggle, grace covers you, you’re fine,” might be giving them <i>false safety</i> and short-circuiting the <i>true safety</i> that would come through radical repentance. Cyprian would rather see the sinner <b>agonize in repentance</b> than be prematurely comforted. He insists the lapsed must <i>“be thoroughly exercised in repentance”</i>, with prayer, fasting, tears – <i>“let not the repentance be less than the sin”</i> he says[<i><sup>newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=of%20a%20Father%20He%20is,out%20nights%20in%20watchings%20and)[newadvent.org</i></sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=us%20greatly%20lament,be%20surrounded%20with%20sackcloth%20and). <i>“Do you think the Lord can be quickly appeased, whom with faithless words you have denied?... You must pray more eagerly and entreat… be clothed in sackcloth… after losing the garment of Christ, you must seek none other… After the devil’s feast, now prefer fasting”[<sup>newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=of%20a%20Father%20He%20is,out%20nights%20in%20watchings%20and)[newadvent.org</i></sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=Lord%20can%20be%20quickly%20appeased%2C,you%20must%20prefer%20fasting%3B%20be)</i>. This dramatic call to penance shows Cyprian’s conviction: a Christian who gravely sins (like apostasy or sexual immorality) <b>risks eternal loss</b>, and their only hope is <b>thorough, humble, prolonged repentance</b>. There’s no cheap grace here.

Cyprian saw two great dangers for those in sin: <b>despair</b> (thinking they can’t be forgiven) and <b>presumption</b> (assuming forgiveness without true conversion). He addresses both: he encourages that God <i>will</i> forgive the truly penitent (he wasn’t a Novatian extremist), but he fiercely rebukes the <i>presumptuous lapsed</i> who demanded instant restoration. In <i>On the Lapsed</i>, chapter 27, he says: <i>“Nor let those persons flatter themselves that they need repent the less, who... defiled their conscience with certificates [of idolatry]. That profession of one who denies is the testimony of a Christian disowning faith… Let him not cease to carry out his repentance and to entreat the Lord’s mercy, <b>lest what seems less in the quality of his fault should be increased by his neglect of atonement</b>.”[<sup>newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L590%2027,testimony%20of%20a%2C%20Christian%20disowning)[newadvent.org</i></sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L634%20and%20let,by%20his%20neglect%20of%20atonement)</i>. This is key: someone might think their sin wasn’t “that bad” – Cyprian says, even if lesser, if you downplay it and skip proper repentance, it becomes <i>worse</i>. A small sin with no repentance can damn as surely as a great sin, because it reveals contempt for God’s holiness.

He goes on: <i>“<b>Do not be moved by that imprudent error of some who neglect the medicine for their wound and will not repent</b>. Thoughtless before their sin was acknowledged, after their sin they are obstinate; neither steadfast before, nor supplicant afterward. When they ought to have stood firm, they fell; when they ought to lie in humility, they think they stand. They have taken peace to themselves when none was given… Their words eat like a cancer; their conversation is like contagion… They who take away repentance for sin, close the way of atonement. Thus it happens that, while by the rashness of some a false safety is either promised or trusted, <b>the hope of true safety is taken away</b>.”[<sup>newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=pleasure%20in%20unrighteousness.,unbelievers%2C%20they%20take%20hold%20of)[newadvent.org</i></sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=34,62%20safety%20is%20taken%20away)</i>. We already cited parts of this, but it bears repeating for emphasis. Cyprian paints a vivid picture of <b>self-satisfied “Christians”</b> who sinned and now refuse to humble themselves. They <i>claim peace</i> without doing the work of repentance. This arrogance – taking grace for granted – is a deadly cancer in the church, he says. Those who preach an easy forgiveness without requiring repentance <i>“close the way of atonement”[<sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=persuasion%20kills%20worse%20than%20persecution,62%20safety%20is%20taken%20away)</i>. In effect, they <b>bar people from actually being forgiven</b>, because forgiveness comes on God’s terms (contrite heart, etc.), not via flippant declarations. What a lesson for today, where many preachers hastily assure audiences of pardon without ever addressing specific sins or calling for heartfelt turning from evil! Cyprian would call that pastoral malpractice that steals souls’ salvation.

Cyprian’s own approach was to impose a period of <i>public penance</i> on the lapsed – they had to demonstrate sorrow over time before readmission. Theologically, he believed <b>no one is beyond God’s mercy</b> if truly penitent (<i>“Let no one ever despair of God’s mercy”</i> he says). But he equally believed <b>no one is saved without repentance</b>. He quotes Scripture such as <i>“Return to Me with all your heart… rend your heart and not your garments”[<sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L642%20whole%20heart%2C,all%20your%20heart%2C%20and%20at)</i> and encourages the lapsed to realize the magnitude of their sin and do works befitting repentance (Joel 2:12–13). Cyprian also echoes Hebrews, warning them not to harden their hearts or rely on <i>“vain stupor”</i>. In chapter 29 he pleads: <i>“Do you in repentance and grief look into your sins; acknowledge the very grave sin of your conscience; open the eyes of your heart to understanding your sin; neither despair of the Lord’s mercy nor yet at once claim His pardon… As we have sinned greatly, so let us greatly lament… let not the repentance be less than the sin.”[<sup>newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=35,wanting%20a%20long%20and%20careful)[newadvent.org</i></sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=misery%2C%20do%20you%20in%20repentance,Think%20you%20that%20the)</i>. He balances: don’t despair (God can forgive), but also don’t claim pardon too fast (you have no right). Fear God as Judge <i>and</i> trust Him as Father, but only after a <i>sincere</i> return.

In sum, <b>Cyprian’s voice is one of fervent warning and earnest pastoral care</b>. He absolutely believed that baptized Christians could <b>lose salvation by serious, willful sin</b> (like apostasy, adultery, etc.), and that some indeed had done so. He called the church to <b>enforce discipline</b> and require evidence of repentance before offering restoration, precisely because souls were at stake. He knew some lapsed would never come back (in fact, he warns that some were demon-possessed or went insane – which he interpreted as divine judgment[<i><sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=not%20repent%20nor%20make%20confession,lapses%20occurring%20in%20the%20world)), but he held out hope for those who <i>humbled themselves</i>. Cyprian has no concept of a “carnal Christian” coasting into heaven. For him, <b>there are penitent Christians on the way to salvation, and impenitent (or false) Christians on the way to damnation</b>. He quotes 1 John 2:4 – those who say they know God but don’t obey are liars[<i><sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=,Revelation%202%3A5). And he exhorts the church to <i>“assist such men with our prayers”</i> that they may be restored, but also to <i>“separate and purge out the offense”</i> (On Lapsed, ch. 15) so that the church remains holy.

Cyprian’s context was unique (persecution), but his principles apply broadly. If he saw our modern situation – multitudes in churches living indistinguishably from the world yet assuming heaven – he would thunder the same rebukes: <i>“Let none deceive themselves. Unless they repent thoroughly, weeping for their sins, they cannot have peace with God. Because some teachers promise them safety in sin, the true hope of salvation is lost!”[<sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=persuasion%20kills%20worse%20than%20persecution,62%20safety%20is%20taken%20away)</i>. That is exactly our concern in this book. The early Church like Cyprian stands with us in affirming: <b>ongoing unrepented sin will lead to perdition, even for the baptized believer</b>. Only repentance and continued holiness lead to eternal life.
## <a name="_toc197890384"></a>John Chrysostom – “Unless You Continue, You Will Be Cut Off”
Moving into the 4th century, we consider **John Chrysostom** (AD 347–407), renowned archbishop of Constantinople. Chrysostom, known as the “golden-mouthed” preacher, left a wealth of homilies on Scripture. In them, he frequently exhorts moral living and perseverance. He lived in a Christianized empire, where many assumed themselves Christian by baptism. Chrysostom fought against complacency by emphasizing **the conditional nature of God’s promises**: God is good, but we must *cooperate* and continue in faith and virtue. We’ll highlight a few pertinent insights from his homilies.

In his **Homily on Romans 11**, commenting on Paul’s metaphor of the olive tree (where Gentile believers are grafted in and Jews were cut off for unbelief), Chrysostom drives home the warning to believers:

*“Behold the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in His goodness; otherwise you also shall be cut off.” (Romans 11:22) — “The blessings do not abide by you unmovable if you turn listless... for thou also, unless thou continue in the faith, will be cut off.”\*[<sup>newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210219.htm#:~:text=And%20he%20does%20not%20say%2C,faith%2C%20will%20be%20cut%20off)[newadvent.org*</sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210219.htm#:~:text=fear%20%3A%20since%20the%20Lord,79%2C%20will%20be%20cut%20off)*

Chrysostom emphasizes Paul’s <b>“if”</b>: God’s kindness toward the Gentile believers is contingent on their continuing. He explicitly refutes any idea that “once grafted, always grafted”: <i>“The blessings do not abide if you grow careless.”</i> If a Christian becomes spiritually “listless” (lazy, complacent), he can indeed be <b>cut off</b> just as the Jews were. Chrysostom even explains, <i>“none of these things is immutable, neither your good nor [the Jews’] evil… he [Paul] humbles the one and encourages the other… He warns the Gentile: ‘you will be cut off if you grow listless.’”[<sup>newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210219.htm#:~:text=For%20it%20was%20not%20God,was%2C%20that%20you%20might%20continue)[newadvent.org</i></sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210219.htm#:~:text=to%20the%20Jew%20to%20be,But%20it%20is%20very)</i>. This is a clear affirmation that a believer’s current standing can change – a sobering possibility. The phrase <i>“neither your good nor his evil is immutable”[<sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210219.htm#:~:text=so%20%28Sav,was%2C%20that%20you%20might%20continue)</i> means: a righteous person can fall, and an evil person can repent – so no one should boast or despair, but take heed. Chrysostom thus upholds human free will in persevering. He states plainly: <b>“There is need of something more than faith… if you do things worthy of God’s love. For there is need of something more than faith.”[<i><sup>newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210219.htm#:~:text=thou%20be%20faint%20at%20hearing,by%20the%20Jews%2C%20and%20what)[newadvent.org</i></sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210219.htm#:~:text=in%20,For%20thou%20also%2C%20he%20says)</b>. Some might misconstrue that, but in context he means a mere start in faith is not enough; one must <i>“continue in His goodness”</i>, i.e., <i>live in a way worthy of God’s grace[<sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210219.htm#:~:text=thou%20be%20faint%20at%20hearing,by%20the%20Jews%2C%20and%20what)</i>. This lines up with James, 1 John, etc., that <b>active obedience must accompany faith</b>.

Chrysostom elsewhere addresses Christian behavior pointedly. In one homily (Homily 3 on Ephesians), he says it’s possible for a believer to *“believe rightly but live evilly, and that person will be punished more severely”* because he disgraces his faith. He is very concerned with **moral conduct as proof of faith**. He often warns against drunkenness, sexual immorality, and the like among churchgoers. In a Homily on Hebrews, he notes how *fearful* the warnings are, and says God uses them to keep us diligent. He interprets Hebrews 10:26–27 straightforwardly: *“A **believer who sins wilfully has no forgiveness but awaits fiery judgment**.”* (Homily 18 on Hebrews). He did believe restoration was possible through repentance (as did all orthodox Fathers), but he emphasized the danger of a hardened state.

One of Chrysostom’s best-known sayings comes from his treatise **On the Priesthood**: he says pastors must be watchful, for *“If **one soul perishes through your negligence, you shall render an account**”* (On Priesthood, Book 6). He took Ezekiel’s watchman concept to heart. That’s partly why he preached so bluntly: to ensure **no one in his care would think sin is trivial**.

His famous motto regarding personal holiness is often quoted: <i>“<b>Be always killing sin, or sin will be killing you</b>.”</i> (Though often attributed to Owen, a similar sentiment is found in Chrysostom’s writings on Romans 8:13 in spirit). Essentially, Chrysostom taught that the Christian life is a constant battle, and if you yield to sin, it brings death even to you who have believed. In fact, the <b>Philip Schaff edition of Chrysostom</b> notes: <i>“He asserts, against the Novatians, that it is possible to put away the guilt of sins <b>committed after baptism, by ceasing from the practice of them and working that which is good[<sup>ccel.org</sup>](https://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf113.iii.iv.xv.html#:~:text=asserts%2C%20as%20against%20the%20Novatians%2C,always%20through%20God%E2%80%99s%20mercy%20and)</b>.”[<sup>ccel.org</sup></i>](https://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf113.iii.iv.xv.html#:~:text=asserts%2C%20as%20against%20the%20Novatians%2C,always%20through%20God%E2%80%99s%20mercy%20and)</i>. That description (from a footnote about his Homily on Ephesians) suggests Chrysostom believed post-baptism sins can be forgiven <i>if</i> one genuinely stops and replaces them with good – basically, repentance and renewed obedience. But that also implies if one does <b>not</b> cease from them, the guilt remains. So Chrysostom would tell a porn-addicted Christian: <i>“Yes, you can be forgiven and cleansed – but you <b>must</b> stop the sin and begin to practice righteousness. Otherwise, you remain guilty and risk the fate of the unbelieving.”</i>

We already saw how he explicated Romans 11:22 with that *“otherwise you too shall be cut off.”* Another powerful line from him: *“Fear can maintain our salvation by causing us not to be high-minded… For if He spared not the natural branches (the Jews), neither will He spare you. This implies that if God spared not those who had long been with Him, **much less will He spare you if you sin**.”* (Homily on Romans 19). He’s explicitly teaching that **sin in a believer will bring judgment**; being “with God” historically (like Israel) didn’t save them when they rebelled, and likewise being a Christian now won’t save *us* if we rebel.

Chrysostom, like other Greek Fathers, believed in synergy: God’s grace initiates, but man must cooperate. He did not teach a Calvinistic irreversible election; he believed a Christian could **fall from grace by their own negligence**. In Homily 13 on Hebrews, he says: *“We are come to share in Christ, **if** we hold fast our confidence firm to the end (Heb 3:14).”* He stresses the word *“if,”* saying it shows *“not all will share, only those who hold their faith firmly to the end.”* He then warns of the evil heart of unbelief that can arise, as Hebrews 3:12 states, causing one to depart from God. He saw it as the duty of believers to *keep their hearts with vigilance*.

In summary, John Chrysostom’s voice continues the early tradition: <b>Christians must persevere in faith and holiness, or they can be cut off and lost.</b> He consistently uses scriptural warnings to admonish his flock to <i>“continue in His goodness”[<sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210219.htm#:~:text=And%20he%20does%20not%20say%2C,faith%2C%20will%20be%20cut%20off)</i>. There is zero hint of “once saved always saved” in his preaching – quite the contrary, he frequently reminds comfortable churchgoers that they might end up worse than unbelievers if they take grace lightly. He once said, <i>“It would be better for us if we were defeated and humbled, than that we should be victorious and puffed up; for <b>victory makes us careless, but fear renders us solicitous</b>.”</i> (Homily on Matthew 5). He knew the value of a holy fear to keep us from carelessness. That echoes the New Testament: <i>“Do not be arrogant, but fear”</i> (Rom 11:20) – precisely the line he expounded.
## <a name="_toc197890385"></a>Augustine of Hippo – Enduring to the End and Admonishing the Flock
Finally, we consider **Augustine** (AD 354–430). Augustine’s theology is complex; by his later years, he strongly taught the sovereignty of God’s grace and the “perseverance of the saints” (that the elect will unfailingly persevere). However, Augustine equally affirmed the visible church contains many who are not elect and will fall away, and that **we must not presume on who is elect except by observing their life**. He often preached to warn **against false security**. For example, in his *Homilies on 1 John*, Augustine says:

*“Let no man say, ‘I am born of God, and so I shall not sin,’ ... “Whosoever is born of God does not commit sin”; and yet again the same Epistle says, “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves.” ... “In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God.” (1 John 3:10) ... If you live unrighteously, you seek to be numbered among the children of the devil.”\*\* (Homily 5 on First John)[<sup>newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/170205.htm#:~:text=,He%20that)[newadvent.org*</sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/170205.htm#:~:text=1,shall%20confess%20himself%20a%20sinner)*

Augustine grapples with 1 John’s tension: believers do still sin (venially), but they don’t live in sin. He tells his congregation essentially, *Don’t claim to be a child of God if you are living in unrighteousness – such a life shows you belong to the devil.* **The necessity of living righteously is non-negotiable for Augustine**. In that same homily he declares: *“No murderer has eternal life abiding in him”* (quoting 1 John 3:15) – so if a Christian were to commit murder or hate his brother, he cannot say he has eternal life unless he repents. Augustine did believe if one is truly regenerated, God’s grace will ultimately cause them to repent and not die in mortal sin; but from a human perspective, one who falls into serious sin is on the road to perdition. Therefore he constantly exhorted self-examination: *“Brethren, let us live in holiness, and we shall not fear the death of the body. ... We must fear that death of the soul, which is **sin persisted in without repentance**.”* (Sermon 65).

Augustine also spoke about **final perseverance** in terms of *“he who endures to the end will be saved.”* He wrote in *City of God* (Book 21, ch. 9) that not all baptized will be saved, only those who persevere. He was adamant that **holiness is required**: *“No one denies that good life is necessary for eternal life.\*\*”* In a letter explaining predestination he remarks: *“No one is certain of eternal life, except the one who perseveres to the end; and we see many who are apparently in grace fall away.”* Thus even with his predestinarian view, Augustine acknowledged the phenomenological reality that some real Christians do apostatize (which he explained as they were never truly redeemed, though in our view they were brethren who fell).

But <b>pastorally</b>, Augustine never told people “Don’t worry, you can’t lose salvation.” Instead, he urged them to cling to Christ and <i>use the means of grace</i> (sacraments, prayer) to continue. One of his quotes (if indeed his) relevant here: <i>“God has promised forgiveness to your repentance, but He has not promised tomorrow to your procrastination.”[<sup>fauxtations.wordpress.com</sup></i>](https://fauxtations.wordpress.com/2022/08/31/st-augustine-repentance-and-procrastination/#:~:text=August%2031%2C%202022%20September%2010%2C,5)</i>. This saying (attributed to Augustine) captures the early church ethic: <b>there is forgiveness if you repent, but don’t presume on a tomorrow – repent now[<i><sup>fauxtations.wordpress.com</sup></i>](https://fauxtations.wordpress.com/2022/08/31/st-augustine-repentance-and-procrastination/#:~:text=August%2031%2C%202022%20September%2010%2C,5)</b>. Whether or not Augustine said those exact words, they reflect his spirit in sermons. He often warned against delaying conversion or repentance, as death can come anytime and the state in which one dies is fixed for eternity.

In his *Homilies on the Gospels*, Augustine expounds the parable of the wise and foolish virgins (Matt 25). He says the foolish virgins’ lack of oil (good works) kept them from entering the feast – showing that *profession alone (lamps) without love and fruit (oil) is not enough*. He famously said, *“He who created you without you will not justify (or save) you without you.”* In other words, **our will must cooperate; God doesn’t save an unwilling soul living in sin**.

On apostasy, Augustine considered that those who fall away were never truly regenerate (an early form of “they went out from us because not of us”). Yet, he also said they did receive some grace: for instance, in *Admonition and Grace* he concedes some have *“the gift of faith but not the gift of perseverance”*, meaning they believed for a while but did not persevere. Thus practically, he acknowledges some believers don’t endure and hence perish – which in our terms is losing salvation (though he’d say they weren’t elect to final salvation).

Augustine’s <b>On Christian Discipline</b> (a short treatise) emphasizes correcting sinning church members so that they might be saved “<b>in the day of the Lord</b>” (he cites 1 Cor 5:5). He supported excommunication not to damn but to awaken the sinner to repent and <i>rejoin the path to salvation</i>. This again shows he viewed unrepentant sin as damning unless reversed. In one letter, Augustine laments some loose priests who did not enforce discipline, saying they <i>“kill those whom they falsely assure of life”</i>, very similar to Cyprian’s <i>“false safety”</i> concern[<i><sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=persuasion%20kills%20worse%20than%20persecution,62%20safety%20is%20taken%20away). He writes, <i>“The unrighteous will not possess the kingdom of God (1 Cor 6:9). They who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom (Gal 5:21). Take heed what you promise; make sure of whom you promise. <b>Certainly, to promise the kingdom to the unrighteous is to kill them outright</b>.”</i> (Sermon 172). Thus Augustine too decries <b>false assurances</b> given to those in deadly sin.

From this survey, we see the <b>continuity</b> of thought from the apostolic age through the 4th century: <b>the church fathers unanimously taught that a Christian must persevere in holiness, and that those who turn back to a life of sin face exclusion from God’s kingdom.</b> Some, like Hermas or Cyprian, expressed it very severely (one chance of repentance, etc.), others like Augustine more gently, but none taught that a Christian living in unrepentant immorality is nevertheless secure in salvation. On the contrary, they explicitly state such a person is <i>“not of God”</i>, “has no eternal life abiding,” “will be cut off,” “shall not inherit the kingdom,” “goes to everlasting fire,” etc.[<i><sup>newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0104.htm#:~:text=Do%20not%20err%20%2C%20my,one%20that%20hearkens%20unto%20him)[newadvent.org</i></sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1701081.htm#:~:text=to%20be%20at%20the%20disposal,fire%3B%20and%20that%20it%20may). They affirmed the warnings of Scripture exactly as written. They also believed in the <b>restorative power of repentance</b> – the door was open for the lapsed to return, albeit with tears and reformation of life. But they urged <b>speedy and sincere repentance</b>, warning that presumption and delay could lead to a point of no return[<i><sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/02011.htm#:~:text=day%2C%20if%20they%20repent%20with,promises%20with%20great%20%2044).

Thus, the early church’s message to someone continuing in pornography (to use our case) would be: <i>“Brother, you are on the way of death. Do not be deceived. You cannot have fellowship with God and partake in the devil’s filth. Repent with urgency – cleanse your heart, seek God’s mercy with fasting and prayer. Cut off this sin as you value your soul. Otherwise, be assured that if you remain in this bondage, you will be excluded from the eternal kingdom and find yourself among those in the lake of fire. This is the teaching we have received and which we pass on: ‘No sexually immoral man has any inheritance in God’s kingdom. Let no one deceive you with empty words’[<sup>newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0714.htm#:~:text=And%20the%20way%20of%20death,pitying%20a%20poor%20man%2C%20not)[newadvent.org</sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0714.htm#:~:text=labouring%20for%20the%20afflicted%2C%20not,delivered%2C%20children%2C%20from%20all%20these). So come out of this deceit, mourn and purify your conscience, and <b>God will receive you</b>. But if you persist, you choose eternal death over life.”</i> This is precisely the stance we see from the Didache to Augustine. It is the stance this book urges once again in our time.

In the next chapter, we will hear a similar witness from the **Reformation-era Puritans**, who, like these church fathers, emphasized that only *“holy, overcoming Christians”* inherit final salvation. They too warned professing believers not to *rest on presumptuous grace* but to examine themselves and evidence their faith by Spirit-wrought obedience. As Richard Baxter, John Owen, and others will remind us: *we must “keep our garments white” and hold fast to Christ to the end, for true faith is a **fighting, persevering faith** that results in the **Saints’ Everlasting Rest**.* Those who instead make peace with sin will find in the end no rest at all, *“but only a terrifying expectation of judgment”* (Heb 10:27).

# Chapter 4: The Puritan Call to Holiness and Conditional Security (Richard Baxter & Co.)
Moving forward over a millennium to the 17th century, we encounter the **Puritans** – English Reformed pastors and theologians known for their deep concern for practical godliness and the eternal state of souls. The Puritans, while holding Reformation doctrines of grace, were pastorally very wary of *antinomianism* (the abuse of grace as an excuse for sin). They emphasized what they often called **“conditional salvation”** or **“conditional justification.”** By this, they did not mean that we earn our salvation, but that the **covenant of grace has conditions** (namely, repentant faith and its fruits), and that *only those believers who fulfill these conditions (by God’s grace) will finally be saved*. In simpler terms, they taught that **continuing in obedient faith is necessary for final salvation**, and conversely that a *professor of faith who lives in unrepentant sin has no grounds to consider himself justified*. In this chapter, we will focus especially on **Richard Baxter** – a leading Puritan divine – and his explicit teachings on the necessity of persevering holiness. Baxter wrote *The Saints’ Everlasting Rest* and *Aphorisms of Justification*, among many other works, dealing precisely with these issues. We will see that Baxter, echoing the early church, insists that a Christian’s hope of heaven is **inseparable from a life of mortification of sin and growth in righteousness**. We will also draw supporting insights from **John Owen**, **Thomas Watson**, and **John Flavel**, other prominent Puritans, to reinforce that this was the common Puritan understanding: **true justifying faith is a fighting, enduring faith that actively *“works by love”* and produces holiness – without which no one will see the Lord**.

It is important to note that many Puritans (especially in the Calvinist tradition) believed in the *eternal security of the elect*, but they simultaneously believed that **God preserves His elect by inclining their wills to holiness and repentance**. Therefore, from the human perspective, they preached that *if one does not persevere in obedience, one proves not to be elect*. In practice, their preaching sounded very much like conditional security, urging believers to make their calling and election sure by diligent holiness (2 Pet 1:10). They did not coddle anyone in sinful complacency by saying *“once saved always saved”*; instead, they would say with the apostle Peter, *“only the one who overcomes and continues in the faith will finally be saved”*. As we shall see, **Richard Baxter in particular was even accused of being too “conditional” in his view of justification**, because he stressed the necessity of continued obedience so strongly. But Baxter’s aim was deeply pastoral: to *wake up the lukewarm and the hypocrite*, and to spur true believers on to greater assurance through holiness. Let us first delve into Baxter’s thought.
## <a name="_toc197890387"></a>Richard Baxter: “No Holiness, No Heaven” – Perseverance as the Path to Rest
<b>Richard Baxter (1615–1691)</b>, a renowned Puritan pastor (author of <i>The Reformed Pastor</i> and many others), ministered in Kidderminster with great effect. He is especially relevant to our topic for two works: <i>The Saints’ Everlasting Rest</i> (1650) – a treatise on heaven and how to live in light of it – and <i>Aphorisms of Justification</i> (1649) – a more doctrinal work on justification, sanctification, and conditions of the new covenant. Baxter fought against both the <b>Antinomians</b> of his day (who so emphasized free grace that they denied the necessity of repentance and holiness) and the <b>Papists</b> (who taught works merit salvation). Baxter’s position was essentially that <b>we are forgiven and accepted by God only for Christ’s sake and by true faith – but that true faith is “conditional,” that is, it <i>obliges</i> us to continued obedience, and God’s promise of final salvation is made only to those who overcome and obey (by grace).</b> Baxter’s language can at times sound like salvation by works, but in context he means not that our works earn any merit, but that <b>the covenant promise (eternal life) is made to a <i>qualified</i> kind of faith – namely, a living, obedient faith.</b> Dead faith (intellectual assent without works) he considered no true faith at all. Thus, <i>in effect</i>, Baxter strongly affirmed: <i>“Without holiness, no man shall see the Lord”[<sup>puritanboard.com</sup></i>](https://puritanboard.com/threads/john-flavel-no-holiness-no-heaven.100420/#:~:text=Q,not%20glorify%20him%20on%20earth)</i>, and <i>“only those servants who persevere in faithful obedience will enter the kingdom.”</i>

In <b>The Saints’ Everlasting Rest</b>, Baxter encourages believers to meditate on heaven and live in a manner befitting those who seek that eternal rest. But he also repeatedly warns nominal Christians of missing that rest through sloth or sin. In one poignant passage, Baxter imagines what it will be like for a godly soul to reflect on how close he was to hell but for grace. The saved soul will think: <i>“Yonder was the place that sin would have brought me to; but this is what Christ has brought me to! Yonder death was the wages of my sin, but this eternal life is the gift of God… If I had continued in my [unconverted] state, I would now have been in torments… Who made me to differ? O Lord, <b>surely it was Thy free grace alone!</b>”[<sup>ccel.org](https://ccel.org/ccel/baxter/saints_rest/saints_rest.iii.III.html#:~:text=from%20that%20to%20which%20we,Who%20made%20me)[ccel.org</i></sup>](https://ccel.org/ccel/baxter/saints_rest/saints_rest.iii.III.html#:~:text=it%20that%20Christ%20hath%20brought,Who%20made%20me)</i>. Note, Baxter fully credits grace for the difference – but he emphasizes the real <b>danger</b> the person was in while in sin.

Baxter famously exhorted self-examination. In *Saints’ Rest*, Chapter 8 (on “The People Who Receive the Rest”), he basically presents **tests of genuine faith**. He insisted that *many* will miss heaven because they were *self-deceived* about their faith. Here is a powerful excerpt:

*“It is a most lamentable thing to see how most men do spend their care, time, and pains for known vanities, while God and glory are neglected… If God would give them leave, they would rather live here forever, though in no higher place or pleasure than their present life affords, than to die and go to heaven. … Examine yourself: Do you make it your chief business to secure your soul? … Do you heartily renounce all other happiness but that which God has promised? Can you say, ‘There is nothing in this world that I desire, but so far as it leads to God; I could sit down with as much content in poverty, if I might have more of God and holiness with it, as in a full estate’? … If any have more of the government of thee than Christ, or if thou hadst rather live after any other laws than His… thou art not His disciple.”\*\*[<sup>ebooks.regent-college.edu](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/130/#:~:text=feigned%20or%20with%20reservations,it%20the%20great%20labor%20of)[ebooks.regent-college.edu*</sup>](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/130/#:~:text=pardoned%2C%20reconciled%20to%20God%2C%20and,thou%20mayst%20not%20tremble%20with)*

This searching passage (partly paraphrased in modern English) shows Baxter’s pastoral heart to <b>unmask false Christians</b>. He basically asks: What do you truly love and live for? If you’d rather enjoy earthly ease indefinitely than go to be with God, your heart is not fit for heaven. If you don’t <b>renounce all other “happiness” except what is in God</b>, you are an idolater at heart. And that last line is a direct quote from Baxter: <i>“If any have more of the government of thee than Christ... thou art not His disciple.”[<sup>ebooks.regent-college.edu](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/130/#:~:text=own%20way%20%3F%20This%20is,approach%20ofdeath%20and%20judgment%20may)[ebooks.regent-college.edu</i></sup>](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/130/#:~:text=feigned%20or%20with%20reservations,thou%20mayst%20not%20tremble%20with)</i> This comes straight from <i>Saints’ Everlasting Rest</i> and is Baxter’s application of Luke 14:33 (unless a man forsake all, he cannot be Christ’s disciple). Baxter allows no divided allegiance. If Christ is truly your Lord, He must rule your heart supremely. If some sin, habit, or worldly goal dominates you more than Christ, <i>you are no true Christian[<sup>goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7646575-if-any-have-more-of-the-government-of-thee-than#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIf%20any%20have%20more%20of,%E2%80%9D)[goodreads.com</i></sup>](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7646575-if-any-have-more-of-the-government-of-thee-than#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIf%20any%20have%20more%20of,%E2%80%9D)</i>. That is a thunderous wake-up call, very relevant to one enslaved to pornography. We can rephrase Baxter: <i>“If lust has more of the rule over you than Christ does, do not deceive yourself: you are not a Christian. You must repent and yield to Christ’s lordship, or you have no part in Him.”</i>

In <i>Saints’ Rest</i>, Baxter also stresses that <b>perseverance to the end is essential</b>. He writes, <i>“Not every one that runs will win the prize, but those who run lawfully and so run as to obtain[<sup>ebooks.regent-college.edu</sup>](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/131/#:~:text=Not%20to%20every%20one%20that,upon%20him%20his%20new%20name). It is not enough to begin in the spirit, and then end in the flesh. <b>He only that endureth to the end shall be saved</b>… There is no crown for starters, but for finishers.”</i> Baxter often used the metaphor of <i>a race or warfare</i>. He exhorted that many seem to begin well (like temporary believers in the parable of the soils), but only those who press on and overcome will get the reward[<i><sup>ebooks.regent-college.edu](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/131/#:~:text=Chap,man%20knoweth%2C%20saving%20he%20that)[ebooks.regent-college.edu</i></sup>](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/131/#:~:text=Not%20to%20every%20one%20that,upon%20him%20his%20new%20name). For example, he references Christ’s promises in Revelation: <i>“Not to every one that presumptuously believeth, but ‘to him that overcometh’ will Christ give the hidden manna… he shall eat of the tree of life… shall not be hurt by the second death… Christ will confess him before the Father… and make him a pillar in God’s temple… and grant him to sit with Him on His throne”[<sup>ebooks.regent-college.edu](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/131/#:~:text=is%20of%20great%20importance%20to,upon%20him%20the%20name%20of)[ebooks.regent-college.edu</i></sup>](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/131/#:~:text=will%20Christ%20give%20to%20eat,throne%2C%20even%20as%20he%20also)</i>. Here Baxter quotes the very passages we mentioned from Rev 2–3[<i><sup>ebooks.regent-college.edu</sup></i>](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/131/#:~:text=Not%20to%20every%20one%20that,upon%20him%20his%20new%20name), emphasizing Christ’s <i>conditional</i> <b>“if you overcome”</b> as the gateway to these glories. Baxter says pointedly: <i>“Not to every presumptuous believer, but to him that <b>overcometh</b>...”[<sup>ebooks.regent-college.edu</sup></i>](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/131/#:~:text=is%20of%20great%20importance%20to,upon%20him%20the%20name%20of)</i> – highlighting that many <i>assume</i> they have a right to heaven simply by professing Christ, but Christ Himself makes the outcome conditional on <b>victorious persevering faith[<i><sup>ebooks.regent-college.edu](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/131/#:~:text=Chap,man%20knoweth%2C%20saving%20he%20that)[ebooks.regent-college.edu</i></sup>](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/131/#:~:text=is%20of%20great%20importance%20to,upon%20him%20the%20name%20of)</b>. Baxter delighted in piling up those Scriptures to shatter false assurance and comfort true strivers.

Now, Baxter’s controversial work **Aphorisms of Justification** lays out his doctrinal perspective more technically. Let’s glean some key statements from it, especially as summarized in a guide he wrote. In *Aphorisms*, Baxter explains different “stages” or aspects of justification (forgiving grace) – conditional and absolute. He says, for instance:

- <b>Justification has an initial conditional grant and a final absolute application</b>: <i>“Our justification after faith (in this life) is ours actually, but yet upon condition of perseverance in faith and sincere obedience.”[<sup>reformedbooksonline.com](https://reformedbooksonline.com/on-the-continuation-of-justification/#:~:text=21,%E2%80%A6)[reformedbooksonline.com</i></sup>](https://reformedbooksonline.com/on-the-continuation-of-justification/#:~:text=faith%2C%20or%20before%20they%20have,%E2%80%A6)</i>
- He distinguishes *first faith* (entry) and *continued faith*: *“There is a difference between the initial right to pardon at conversion, and the continued right which is confirmed only if we abide in Christ. The new covenant giveth us right to Christ’s benefits **upon condition of perseverance**.”*
- Baxter goes on: <i>“As there is a great difference between <b>our first title to justification</b> and the <b>continuation and consummation of it</b>; so it is with the conditions thereof. <b>Our first title is upon condition of initial faith (and repentance)</b>… <b>Our continued and consummate justification is upon condition of persevering faith and obedience[<sup>reformedbooksonline.com</sup>](https://reformedbooksonline.com/on-the-continuation-of-justification/#:~:text=27,%E2%80%9D)</b>.”</i>

In plain language, Baxter is asserting that when you first truly believe (and repent), God truly forgives and justifies you. But that pardon is covenantally <b>conditioned on you continuing in that faith and obedience[<i><sup>reformedbooksonline.com](https://reformedbooksonline.com/on-the-continuation-of-justification/#:~:text=21,%E2%80%A6)[reformedbooksonline.com</i></sup>](https://reformedbooksonline.com/on-the-continuation-of-justification/#:~:text=27,%E2%80%9D)</b>. If you were to abandon the faith later (or live in unrepentant disobedience), you would forfeit the benefits – you would not receive final salvation, because the promise of salvation was made to <i>believers</i>, and you ceased to be a believer in the practical sense[<i><sup>reformedbooksonline.com</sup></i>](https://reformedbooksonline.com/on-the-continuation-of-justification/#:~:text=21,%E2%80%A6). Thus initial justification can be seen as <i>conditional/potential</i>, and it is “confirmed/absolute” only after one has run the race. He even says the new covenant itself, while gracious, <b>contains warnings and conditions which if not met will leave a person condemned[<i><sup>reformedbooksonline.com</sup></i>](https://reformedbooksonline.com/on-the-continuation-of-justification/#:~:text=25,%E2%80%A6)</b>. He points to the “accusation of the Gospel for not performing its conditions… from which no man can be justified, and for which there is no sacrifice”[<i><sup>reformedbooksonline.com</sup></i>](https://reformedbooksonline.com/on-the-continuation-of-justification/#:~:text=25,%E2%80%A6) – clearly referencing Hebrews 10:26 (no sacrifice remains for willful sin)[<i><sup>reformedbooksonline.com</sup></i>](https://reformedbooksonline.com/on-the-continuation-of-justification/#:~:text=25,%E2%80%A6). In Baxter’s schema: break the <b>new covenant conditions</b> (persistent unbelief/disobedience), and the Gospel itself accuses you with no remedy[<i><sup>reformedbooksonline.com</sup></i>](https://reformedbooksonline.com/on-the-continuation-of-justification/#:~:text=25,%E2%80%A6). However, he also says that by God’s grace true believers <i>will be enabled</i> to fulfill those conditions (persevere)[<i><sup>reformedbooksonline.com</sup></i>](https://reformedbooksonline.com/on-the-continuation-of-justification/#:~:text=21,%E2%80%A6). Nevertheless, he urges us not to “separate the inheritance from the precepts” – meaning don’t think you get the inheritance regardless of following the Lord’s commands[<i><sup>reformedbooksonline.com</sup></i>](https://reformedbooksonline.com/on-the-continuation-of-justification/#:~:text=27,%E2%80%9D); they go together.

One particularly striking Baxterian aphorism: <i>“<b>He that will have Christ’s blessings must consent to His terms</b>… for it is a ‘marriage-covenant’… If you take Him, He takes you; but if you forsake Him, you forfeit all.”</i> (Paraphrase from <i>Aphorisms</i> Guide, points 20–27[<i><sup>reformedbooksonline.com](https://reformedbooksonline.com/on-the-continuation-of-justification/#:~:text=%E2%80%9C,have%20performed%20all%20the%20conditions)[reformedbooksonline.com</i></sup>](https://reformedbooksonline.com/on-the-continuation-of-justification/#:~:text=27,%E2%80%9D)). This aligns perfectly with what we’ve been saying: <b>an unfaithful bride (professing Christian) who abandons her groom (Christ) cannot expect to enjoy the marriage feast</b>; she has broken covenant. Only those who keep the covenant (by <i>remaining</i> in Christ by faithfulness) will celebrate in the end.

Baxter’s teaching may sound a bit technical, but its practical upshot is captured in his more popular writings and sermons: <b>he relentlessly told people that they must strive for holiness, continue in repentance, and not imagine that an empty faith without works or an initiation without perseverance could save them</b>. This is classically summed up in another Puritan slogan: <i>“No holiness, no heaven.”</i> Indeed, in a catechism on the covenant, John Flavel asks: <i>“Can none be saved without holiness on earth?”</i> Answer: <i>“No adult person can scripturally expect happiness in heaven without holiness on earth; ‘without holiness no man shall see the Lord’[<sup>puritanboard.com</sup>](https://puritanboard.com/threads/john-flavel-no-holiness-no-heaven.100420/#:~:text=Q,not%20glorify%20him%20on%20earth).”[<sup>puritanboard.com</sup></i>](https://puritanboard.com/threads/john-flavel-no-holiness-no-heaven.100420/#:~:text=Q,not%20glorify%20him%20on%20earth)</i> That was standard Puritan fare.
## <a name="_toc197890388"></a>John Owen, Thomas Watson, John Flavel: Warnings from Fellow Puritans
Let’s briefly bring in a few supporting quotes from Baxter’s contemporaries to show this was not an idiosyncratic view:

<b>John Owen (1616–1683)</b>, known for his treatise <i>The Mortification of Sin</i>, famously exhorted believers: <i>“Do you mortify; do you make it your daily work? Be always at it while you live; cease not a day from this work; <b>be killing sin or it will be killing you</b>.”[<sup>goodreads.com</sup></i>](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/963394-mortification-of-sin-in-believers-the-necessity-nature-and-means-of-it#:~:text=Like)</i> This succinctly captures the Puritan urgency: if you don’t actively put your sin to death, it will take your life (spiritually and perhaps even physically). Sin isn’t neutral; <i>unmortified sin will, in Owen’s words, “darken the soul and destroy its peace... and if it gets strength, it will utterly harden”</i> (Mortification, ch. 2). Owen did believe in the perseverance of the truly regenerate, but as a means God uses, He puts this duty of mortification on the believer. He warned that <b>allowing the flesh to rule unchallenged is soul-killing</b>. This aligns exactly with Romans 8:13, which Owen expounded: <i>“If you live after the flesh, <b>you shall die</b>; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, <b>you shall live</b>.”</i> The implication for a porn-addicted person is clear in Owen: If you do not go to war against that lust, it <i>will</i> be killing you – it will choke your soul, perhaps even to apostasy. But if by the Spirit’s power you continually slay it, you will live. Owen would not have comforted someone in such sin with “don’t worry about your salvation”; he would have said, <i>“Repent and fight, or you will perish.”</i>

<b>Thomas Watson (1620–1686)</b>, another beloved Puritan, in his <i>Doctrine of Repentance</i> wrote an incisive warning: <i>“It is not falling into water that drowns, but <b>lying in it</b>. It is not falling into sin that damns, but <b>lying in it without repentance</b>.”[<sup>jamesmirror.com](https://jamesmirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/highlights-from-the-doctrine-of-repentance.pdf#:~:text=love%3F%20As%20God%20has%20two,results%20at%20last%20in%20the)[jamesmirror.com</i></sup>](https://jamesmirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/highlights-from-the-doctrine-of-repentance.pdf#:~:text=places%20he%20dells%20in%2C%20hell,Hardness%20of%20heart%20results%20at)</i>. Watson thus distinguished between the Christian who might fall into a sin but then gets out of it (repents), versus one who <i>“lies in it”</i> (continues, no repentance). The latter, he says bluntly, <b>will be damned[<i><sup>jamesmirror.com](https://jamesmirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/highlights-from-the-doctrine-of-repentance.pdf#:~:text=love%3F%20As%20God%20has%20two,results%20at%20last%20in%20the)[jamesmirror.com</i></sup>](https://jamesmirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/highlights-from-the-doctrine-of-repentance.pdf#:~:text=places%20he%20dells%20in%2C%20hell,Hardness%20of%20heart%20results%20at)</b>. This quote directly supports our theme: a true believer may stumble, but he cannot settle in sin; if someone does settle in sin, it shows he’s headed for damnation unless he’s jolted into repentance. Watson also said, <i>“<b>Till sin be bitter, Christ will not be sweet</b>.”</i> He meant that one who excuses or cherishes sin has not truly savored Christ by faith. The implication for those coddling a “pet sin” is that they likely have not truly embraced Christ, or at least are not currently in a position of enjoying His saving sweetness. Watson’s many sermons also echo the refrain that one sin lived in, loved and not fought, is enough to damn the soul (because it reveals an unrenewed heart). He wrote, <i>“A godly man may fall into sin, but he is soon out; whereas the wicked lie wallowing in sin”</i>. So the Puritans drew a sharp line: <b>The godly fight and rise from sin; the hypocrites wallow in it</b>. Thus if you find yourself “wallowing,” you have no right to think you’re saved.

<b>John Flavel (1627–1691)</b> likewise admonished that <i>“No man can scripturally expect heaven without holiness”</i>, as we saw in his Q&A[<i><sup>puritanboard.com</sup></i>](https://puritanboard.com/threads/john-flavel-no-holiness-no-heaven.100420/#:~:text=Q,not%20glorify%20him%20on%20earth). He also preached on self-deception. In one discourse he said: <i>“They that sow to their flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption [Gal 6:8]; and do you think God will save you, when you will not be saved from your sins? What ground hath any man to think he shall go to heaven, whose life is earthly, who ‘minds earthly things’ (Phil 3:19)? No more than a swine to think it shall go to a feast, because it’s fed in a fair meadow. <b>No, no; if you live after the flesh, you shall die.</b>”</i> Here Flavel appeals to common sense: how can someone living carnally in love with the world think he’s prepared for heaven? He cannot; Scripture opposes it. The swine metaphor is striking – one may enjoy some earthly providences (the fair meadow), but if one is swinish in nature, one is fit for slaughter, not feasting – an allusion to judgment. And he again quotes Romans 8:13’s warning of death[<i><sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210219.htm#:~:text=And%20he%20does%20not%20say%2C,faith%2C%20will%20be%20cut%20off).

In sum, the **Puritans** vigorously affirmed exactly what we are contending: **Continued pornography use (as one example of enslaving sin) is utterly inconsistent with a state of grace**, and unless it is repented of and mortified, it will drag the soul to hell. They held that a true Christian may fall into that snare, but he will – by God’s grace – be brought to repentance, fight it, and not “lie in it.” If someone continues on impenitently, the Puritans would counsel that person to consider himself unsaved and fly to Christ for true deliverance and pardon. They wouldn’t lull him with unconditional eternal security talk; they’d press the *conditions of the covenant* on him – *“Repent and believe in a living way!”*

Richard Baxter’s **“Saints’ Rest”** has a memorable summation addressing the reader’s conscience: *“Thus, reader, I have given thee some brief directions; if thou canst not by these be brought to value and seek after this rest [in heaven], I am afraid thy case is dangerous. If thou be a Christian indeed, thou wilt see more reason to obey than I can shew thee… **I charge thee, from the living God, that thou do not wilfully neglect thy soul!**”* Baxter pleads and charges the reader to take action – *do not neglect your soul*. This resonates with our own plea: **If you continue to neglect these warnings and cling to your lust, you are willfully neglecting your soul – and we charge you before God to stop and consider.** The path you’re on ends in the lake of fire. But today, there is yet a path of return through repentance, faith, and the sanctifying grace of Christ.

Let us close this chapter with Baxter’s own words of encouragement to those who <i>do</i> turn and persevere. In <i>Saints’ Rest</i>, after many warnings, he lifts the penitent’s eyes to Christ: <i>“Oh, how unworthily do most men think of Christ, that they will not part with a lust, or a little pleasure or profit, or ease, for Him! That they dare not trust Him for their salvation! ... <b>But those who have truly received Christ have thereby broken their league with sin and fully engaged their hearts to Him.</b></i>”[<i><sup>ebooks.regent-college.edu](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/130/#:~:text=1R%20128%20OUR%20TITLE%20TO,lay%20down%20to%20be%20inquired)[ebooks.regent-college.edu</i></sup>](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/130/#:~:text=give%20thee%20leave%2C%20thou%20hadst,of%20salvation%2C%20nor%20whether%20thou) Here Baxter notes that many <i>refuse</i> to give up lust or ease for Christ – showing they value that more. But the true receiver of Christ <i>breaks league with sin</i>. If you truly come to Christ, you <i>must and will</i> break your covenant with your lust and engage your heart to Christ as Lord. Baxter continues, <i>“They <b>are not of Christ’s religion who have not parted with their sins, and changed the stream of their affections</b>, and made Him their highest desire and delight.”</i> This is essentially the Puritan definition of a <i>real Christian</i>. If that’s not you, the Puritans would say: do not rest till it is.

The collective testimony of these faithful men of old agrees with Scripture and the early church: **Only those who *by grace* conquer their sins (instead of being conquered by them) will inherit the everlasting rest.** Those who choose to remain *friends of sin* show themselves *enemies of God* and will share the devil’s torment. Therefore, heed this warning and **embrace the grace of God which not only freely forgives but also teaches us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts** (Titus 2:11–12). The same Christ who died to atone for our sins *also* rose again to pour out His Spirit and *“turn every one of you from your wicked ways”* (Acts 3:26). Puritan theology harmonizes with the apostolic: *Jesus is a perfect Savior, able to save to the uttermost those who come to God by Him (Heb 7:25) – but coming to God by Him includes leaving your idols and submitting to Him as Lord. Grace is free, but it is not cheap; it calls for **total allegiance**.*

In conclusion, we have now heard from Scripture, the early church, and the Puritans a unified message. The next and final step is to apply it personally: <i>“Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith”</i> (2 Cor 13:5). Dear reader, if you name the name of Christ yet continue in pornography or any willful sin, these pages have made the danger abundantly clear. <b>You cannot serve two masters</b>. Will you obey the voice of God’s Word and Spirit, <b>“Come out from among them and be separate… and I will receive you”</b> (2 Cor 6:17)? Or will you harden your heart and presume on grace, thereby treasuring up wrath for yourself? The promise and the warning are before you: <i>“If we confess and forsake our sins, we shall have mercy”[<sup>jamesmirror.com](https://jamesmirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/highlights-from-the-doctrine-of-repentance.pdf#:~:text=love%3F%20As%20God%20has%20two,results%20at%20last%20in%20the)[jamesmirror.com</i></sup>](https://jamesmirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/highlights-from-the-doctrine-of-repentance.pdf#:~:text=places%20he%20dells%20in%2C%20hell,Hardness%20of%20heart%20results%20at)</i> – but <i>“if we go on sinning willfully… there remains no sacrifice, only a fearful expectation of judgment”</i> (Heb 10:26–27).

Our prayer is that you will choose the fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom (Prov 9:10), and through that fear be driven to <b>true repentance</b>. For <i>“surely His salvation is near to those who fear Him”</i> (Ps 85:9). Forsake the deception of pornography; it promises pleasure but pays with death. <b>Embrace the Savior, Jesus Christ</b>, who promises <i>“freedom indeed”</i> (John 8:36) and <i>“eternal life to those who by patient continuance in doing good seek glory, honor, and immortality”[<sup>ebooks.regent-college.edu](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/131/#:~:text=Chap,man%20knoweth%2C%20saving%20he%20that)[ebooks.regent-college.edu</i></sup>](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/131/#:~:text=important%2C%20that%20he%20who%20performeth,upon%20him%20the%20name%20of)</i>. Do not rest until you can say with a sincere heart what Richard Baxter and all true saints have said: <i>“I take God in Christ for my only rest, and <b>I will value no treasure or pleasure that would keep me from Him.</b>”[<sup>christiansoldiers.co.za](https://www.christiansoldiers.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/The_saints_everlasting_rest_quotes.pdf#:~:text=Quotes%20from%20The%20saints%20everlasting,May%20the%20living%20God)[christiansoldiers.co.za</i></sup>](https://www.christiansoldiers.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/The_saints_everlasting_rest_quotes.pdf#:~:text=2%20www,May%20the%20living%20God)</i> Then, and only then, you may have the solid assurance that <b>“Saints shall indeed have an everlasting rest”</b>.

# Chapter 5: Modern Diminution
**Abstract:** Modern churches—**even those outwardly thriving in faith—have subtly diminished the urgent warnings against sin that characterized the early Christian community.** This chapter explores how many contemporary evangelical churches have softened or altogether removed cautions about post-conversion sin, especially sexual immorality like pornography. A prevailing confidence in doctrines such as “once saved, always saved” or a misconstrued form of “perseverance of the saints” has contributed to an atmosphere where believers feel **eternally secure regardless of their conduct.** By examining sermons, teachings, and denominational statements from widely respected evangelical sources (rather than fringe or “easy targets”), we will see how warnings of judgment for believers persisting in sin have been toned down or ignored. This stands in stark contrast to the early church’s frank admonitions and rigorous call to purity. The chapter will cite examples from influential modern pastors and official church doctrines to illustrate this softening. Ultimately, it argues that this **modern diminution** of holiness and warning not only departs from apostolic precedent, but also endangers souls by lulling professing believers into a false sense of security despite ongoing sinful practices. *(All Scripture quotations are from the NASB.)*
## <a name="_toc197890390"></a>The Vanishing Warnings in Today’s Churches
In many contemporary churches, one finds an atmosphere of assurance so strong that warnings about sin’s consequences have all but vanished. Even <b>vibrant evangelical congregations</b>, known for energetic worship and doctrinal confession, often shy away from explicitly telling their members that persistent sin can jeopardize their salvation. This reticence is not limited to obviously compromised or liberal churches; it is evident even in assemblies that otherwise seem faithful. The result is a generation of churchgoers who assume all is well with their souls, even as they indulge in habitual sins like pornography, drunkenness, or greed, rarely (if ever) hearing a sermon that such behavior, if unrepented, leads to damnation. One New Zealand pastor, reflecting on his experience in an evangelical church, admitted he felt <b>“uncomfortable with the ‘soft’ message”</b> he heard from a sermon on a harsh biblical passage. He noticed some self-identified believers living “anything but ‘Christian’” lives—yet absolutely confident of their salvation[<i><sup>alltogether.co.nz</sup></i>](https://alltogether.co.nz/a-secure-salvation-and-modern-church-preaching/#:~:text=I%20wrote%20this%20reflection%20to,preaching%20in%20many%20of%20our). His frank assessment was that <b>preachers themselves often give “overly-softened messages” that compromise truth</b>, perhaps out of fear of offending people[<i><sup>alltogether.co.nz</sup></i>](https://alltogether.co.nz/a-secure-salvation-and-modern-church-preaching/#:~:text=I%20wrote%20this%20reflection%20to,preaching%20in%20many%20of%20our). In short, <b>the clear New Testament warnings to Christians have been muted</b>. Many believers have never been told that those who “practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God” (Gal. 5:21), or if they have heard it, they assume it applies only to unbelievers, not to themselves. This represents a striking change from the preaching of the apostles and the early church, who did not hesitate to warn even the baptized that <b>continuing in grievous sin would exclude them from Christ’s kingdom</b>.
## <a name="_toc197890391"></a>Softening the Message to Avoid Offense
Why have these warnings faded? A key factor is that modern church leaders, often unconsciously, <b>soften their message to avoid conflict with prevailing theological comforts in the pews</b>. As evangelical pastor Dave Mann observed, many preachers feel a “subtle... pressure” to <b>“avoid conflict with theological positions held by [members]”</b>, resulting in <b>“softening what the Scriptures say”[<i><sup>alltogether.co.nz</sup></i>](https://alltogether.co.nz/a-secure-salvation-and-modern-church-preaching/#:~:text=Calvinism%20versus%20Arminianism%20is%20an,became%20increasingly%20aware%20of%2C%20and)</b>. In evangelical circles over the last century, one deeply held position is the belief that a Christian’s salvation is absolutely secure once they have believed—no matter what sins might follow. Preachers know that questioning this gives rise to controversy. Thus, even when preaching from challenging texts that originally carried stern warnings, they may tread lightly or explain away the gravity of the passage. Mann confesses that he himself at times <b>“softened some truths”</b> to not “offend others’ theology,” taking the easier path of emphasizing comforting interpretations[<i><sup>alltogether.co.nz</sup></i>](https://alltogether.co.nz/a-secure-salvation-and-modern-church-preaching/#:~:text=Calvinism%20versus%20Arminianism%20is%20an,became%20increasingly%20aware%20of%2C%20and). The theology he alludes to is often a form of <b>guaranteed eternal security</b>. If people in the congregation have been taught “once saved, always saved,” a pastor who implies a believer could forfeit salvation by returning to sin risks pushback. <b>To avoid this, many choose silence or generalities over clarity and warning.</b> The <b>“fear of man…override[s] the fear of God”</b> in shaping sermon content[<i><sup>alltogether.co.nz</sup></i>](https://alltogether.co.nz/a-secure-salvation-and-modern-church-preaching/#:~:text=felt%20we%20preachers%20were%20often,Join%20me%20on%20this%20two). This dynamic leads even earnest pastors to focus on God’s promises but neglect His threats, inadvertently fostering a one-sided message. Over time, churchgoers internalize a gospel of <b>cheap grace</b>—grace that <b>forgives without transformation</b>. The late theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer famously labeled this <i>“the deadly enemy of our church”</i>: <i>“Cheap grace is the preaching of forgiveness without requiring repentance… baptism without church discipline… Communion without confession… grace without discipleship, grace without the cross, grace without Jesus Christ”[<sup>thegospelcoalition.org</sup></i>](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/themelios/article/the-skim-milk-gospel-of-cheap-grace/#:~:text=,%28Part%20I%2C%20Chapter%201)</i>. His critique, though penned in the 1930s, reads like a diagnosis of today’s evangelical culture. In many churches, <b>forgiveness is preached, but practical repentance and holiness are downplayed</b>. Personal sins, especially sexual sins that hide behind closed doors, are handled with kid gloves—if handled at all—lest the grace message be perceived as too “harsh.” But as we will see, <b>this softening is a far cry from the stance of the early church</b>, and even from Scripture itself, which holds grace and godly fear in healthy tension.
## <a name="_toc197890392"></a>The Influence of “Once Saved, Always Saved”
Central to this modern diminishment of warning is the popular doctrine commonly phrased as **“once saved, always saved.”** This teaching, prevalent in Baptist and many non-denominational circles, insists that once a person has truly accepted Christ, they can never finally lose salvation. A more theologically nuanced version in Reformed circles is the **“perseverance of the saints”** – the idea that all whom God has truly saved will persevere in faith and holiness to the end by His power. In theory, perseverance doctrine encourages holy living, teaching that the elect *will* continue in good works. **In practice, however, many believers interpret “perseverance” as a guarantee of heaven regardless of subsequent behavior**, effectively merging it with “once saved, always saved.” Over time, the nuance is lost and only the reassurance remains.

We need only look at official statements of faith to see how this theology is communicated. For example, the Southern Baptist Convention’s <i>Baptist Faith and Message</i> (2000), widely respected and influential, teaches that <b>“All true believers endure to the end”</b> and that those accepted in Christ <b>“will never fall away from the state of grace, but shall persevere to the end.”</b> It concedes that believers may fall into sin and face temporal judgments, <b>“yet they shall be kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation.”[<i><sup>bfm.sbc.net</sup></i>](https://bfm.sbc.net/bfm2000/#:~:text=All%20true%20believers%20endure%20to,God%20through%20faith%20unto%20salvation)</b>. The intent of this statement is to magnify God’s keeping power—and indeed, God is faithful. <b>But the unintended effect on the average church member can be complacency</b>. Many read <i>“will never fall away”</i> as an assurance that <b>no sin or failure on their part could possibly separate them from salvation</b>.

Tragically, some prominent evangelical teachers have gone even further, making blanket statements that virtually <i>eliminate</i> any fear of judgment for the professed believer. <b>Charles Stanley</b>, a widely respected Baptist pastor, asserted in his book <i>Eternal Security: Can You Be Sure?</i> that <i>“Even if a believer… becomes an unbeliever, his salvation is not in jeopardy.”</i> He taught that a Christian could <i>“sin like the devil”</i> and yet <b>“you won’t lose your salvation.”[<i><sup>bible.lockman.org</sup></i>](https://bible.lockman.org/htm_php-c.php?do=show_node&b=67&c=0&v=0&show_ti=2966&show_ts=1&show_user_id=ca7a55acd81d7f5cdd0c6cff2c0bc96e&show_question_id=17377#:~:text=,Security%2C%20Can%20You%20Be%20Sure)</b>. According to such teaching, <b>even renouncing the faith or indulging in the worst sins cannot undo one’s salvation</b>. While not all evangelical leaders go to that extreme, these statements have been circulated to millions through books and broadcasts, shaping the outlook of laypeople. It is easy to see how, under such teaching, <b>any warning after conversion seems unnecessary or at least not urgent</b>. If <i>nothing</i> can annul a saved person’s status as a child of God—if, as Stanley claims, even a born-again person who later becomes an atheist is still saved[<i><sup>bible.lockman.org</sup></i>](https://bible.lockman.org/htm_php-c.php?do=show_node&b=67&c=0&v=0&show_ti=2966&show_ts=1&show_user_id=ca7a55acd81d7f5cdd0c6cff2c0bc96e&show_question_id=17377#:~:text=,3%2C%20MH190)—then the logical conclusion for many is that <b>sin may harm their fellowship with God, but not their ultimate destiny</b>.

Even among Calvinist teachers who stress holiness, one often hears the reassurance that those truly saved will *inevitably* repent before dying. Thus, warnings of perdition for sin are framed as “means God uses to keep us on track” rather than real possibilities for the regenerate. The result? The average church member, lacking theological subtlety, simply hears: **“Real Christians can’t lose salvation, and I’m a real Christian because I professed faith—so I should be fine.”** This mindset can neutralize the effect of biblical warnings. A sermon on sexual purity might be delivered, and a listener hooked on pornography may feel a twinge of guilt. But if he has been taught that grace means **his salvation stays intact in spite of ongoing sin**, he quickly reassures himself that perhaps he’ll lose some rewards in heaven, but surely not heaven itself. In this way, **the doctrine of unconditional security can function, in the pew, as a shield against conviction**. Rather than spurring the believer to examine himself and fear the Lord, it can breed an unhealthy self-assurance.

It is important to note that historically, this idea of absolute security was <b>not the consensus of the church prior to the Reformation</b>. In fact, <b>no Christian teaching before the 16th century claimed that a true believer could never lose salvation</b>. As one historical survey notes, <i>“It was not until the time of John Calvin that anyone would claim that it was impossible for a true Christian to lose his salvation.”</i> All prior generations would have condemned “once saved, always saved” as <b>“dangerous heresy.”[<i><sup>catholic.com</sup></i>](https://www.catholic.com/tract/mortal-sin#:~:text=It%20was%20not%20until%20the,them%20into%20thinking%20that%20their)</b> Even the magisterial Reformers like Luther did not teach it outright. Over the centuries, the doctrine evolved and, in some evangelical circles, <b>degenerated into an extreme form</b>: <i>“some would claim that a Christian could commit grave sins and remain saved: sin did not injure his relationship with God at all.”[<sup>catholic.com</sup></i>](https://www.catholic.com/tract/mortal-sin#:~:text=In%20time%20the%20%E2%80%9Conce%20saved%2C,relationship%20with%20God%20at%20all)</i>. While mainstream Evangelical pastors would deny encouraging sin, the practical outcome of their preaching sometimes comes perilously close to this <b>antinomian attitude</b>. By <b>emphasizing comfort and minimizing exhortation</b>, they risk giving sinning believers false comfort. We will examine specific examples of how respected modern sources handle (or fail to handle) the issue of sin after conversion.
## <a name="_toc197890393"></a>Respected Voices with Softened Warnings
To understand the **breadth of this issue**, we should consider several representative voices from within respectable evangelicalism. These are not fringe prosperity preachers or antinomian cultists, but **mainstream leaders and statements** that carry weight for large numbers of Christians.

One example is the aforementioned <b>Charles Stanley</b>, whose teachings on eternal security have been consumed by millions. His stance, summarized earlier, effectively removes any scenario in which a regenerate person could end up lost. By teaching that even apostasy or “sinning like the devil” cannot cost salvation[<i><sup>bible.lockman.org</sup></i>](https://bible.lockman.org/htm_php-c.php?do=show_node&b=67&c=0&v=0&show_ti=2966&show_ts=1&show_user_id=ca7a55acd81d7f5cdd0c6cff2c0bc96e&show_question_id=17377#:~:text=,Security%2C%20Can%20You%20Be%20Sure), Stanley undeniably <b>downplays the threat of damnation for the professing believer who lives in sin</b>. Listeners inclined to sin find in such words a ready excuse to delay or avoid repentance. It is telling that Stanley felt the need to make such statements—likely to reassure struggling Christians of God’s grace. But in doing so, he (perhaps unintentionally) undermined the very biblical calls to <i>“pursue... sanctification, without which no one will see the Lord”</i> (Heb. 12:14).

Another influential source is denominational literature. The Southern Baptist Convention, as noted, teaches perseverance of the saints. Its wording, while balanced in intent, <b>emphasizes security over warning</b>. The phrase <i>“never fall away… kept by the power of God”</i> in the Baptist Faith and Message[<i><sup>bfm.sbc.net</sup></i>](https://bfm.sbc.net/bfm2000/#:~:text=All%20true%20believers%20endure%20to,God%20through%20faith%20unto%20salvation) rings louder in minds of church members than the clause about believers possibly <i>“falling into sin through neglect”</i> and bringing <i>“temporal judgments on themselves.”</i> Any notion that such sin, if unrepented, could result in <b>eternal judgment</b> is absent from that statement. Similarly, many evangelical churches have doctrinal summaries that assure believers of salvation but do not mention the possibility of apostasy. A church member who reads these summaries would never guess that the New Testament contains severe warnings to Christians. Thus, even at the official level, warnings have been trimmed away.

Consider also the common evangelistic approach of the last hundred years: the *“sinner’s prayer”* emphasis. People are often taught that if they prayed to receive Christ sincerely, they are saved. Follow-up usually encourages joining a church and growing, but seldom includes a *warning* like: *“If you turn back to a life of sin, you will perish.”* On the contrary, new converts are often immediately assured that their salvation can never be lost. While meant to give newborn Christians confidence in God’s grace, this practice has unfortunately produced legions of nominal believers who **recall a moment of decision as their guaranteed ticket to heaven**, even if their lives show no ongoing repentance.

Even some **Calvinist teachers**, champions of “perseverance,” have at times leaned more on reassurance than warning. For instance, a well-known Reformed preacher, aiming to comfort timid souls, once said that **a true Christian who fell into grievous sin would inevitably feel conviction and return to Christ before death by God’s grace.** While this may often be true, it is not a biblical guarantee explicitly stated for every case; rather, Scripture holds out the *possibility* of failing to inherit the kingdom (e.g. Gal. 5:19–21) as a real danger. By constantly assuring “true believers” that they *will* repent eventually, pastors can unwittingly strip these warning passages of their force. Many hear such assurances and conclude, *“Well, I know I’m a true believer—I must be, I had an experience of conversion—so these dire warnings in Scripture must not actually be meant for me.”* This reasoning may not be what the pastor intended, but it is a **pervasive deduction in the minds of congregants**.

One of the most sobering realities is how this plays out regarding <b>sexual sin, especially pornography</b>. Sexual immorality is one of the very sins repeatedly named in the New Testament as soul-damning if unrepented (Eph. 5:5–6, Col. 3:5–6). Yet, in many churches today, <b>pornography among congregants is rampant and yet rarely addressed with warnings of hell.</b> Statistics bear out the extent of the problem. Recent surveys found that over <b>two-thirds of churchgoing men and about half of pastors view pornography regularly[<i><sup>afa.net</sup></i>](https://www.afa.net/the-stand/family/2020/07/porn-and-the-church/#:~:text=%2A%2068%25%20of%20church,damaging%20issue%20in%20their%20congregation)</b>. Astonishingly, <b>69% of pastors say porn has adversely impacted their church</b>, yet <b>only 7% of churches have a program to help people struggling with pornography[<i><sup>afa.net</sup></i>](https://www.afa.net/the-stand/family/2020/07/porn-and-the-church/#:~:text=%2A%2057,has%20adversely%20impacted%20the%20church)</b>. These figures suggest that <b>churches acknowledge the problem’s prevalence but have largely failed to confront it proactively.</b> People in the pews, including leaders, are trapped in secret sexual sin, but structured accountability or church discipline is exceedingly rare. Why? At least part of the reason is that <b>few leaders truly believe these sins put one’s soul in immediate peril</b>. If a pastor were utterly convinced that half his men were on the road to damnation due to porn use, would he not sound a trumpet call of alarm? Instead, the typical approach is to treat porn as a regrettable struggle that “many Christians deal with,” offering private counsel or generic encouragement about God’s forgiveness. The <b>early church’s uncompromising stance</b>—“abstain from fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul” (1 Pet. 2:11)—is rarely echoed with specificity. Pastors fear driving people away with talk of hell, or they assume these men are “saved but struggling” and thus do not press the urgency of repentance. This pastoral hesitancy is a direct fruit of the security-focused theology that dominates evangelicalism. It leads to an <b>absence of church discipline</b> in cases of moral failure. Indeed, one of Bonhoeffer’s charges in <i>The Cost of Discipleship</i> was that <i>“cheap grace is baptism without church discipline”[<sup>thegospelcoalition.org</sup></i>](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/themelios/article/the-skim-milk-gospel-of-cheap-grace/#:~:text=,%28Part%20I%2C%20Chapter%201)</i>. Today, church discipline (publicly correcting or excommunicating unrepentant sinners) is exceedingly rare outside of a few denominations, meaning that a member hooked on pornography is unlikely ever to face official censure as long as he’s somewhat discrete. This would have been unthinkable in the early church (when penitents had to undergo public repentance), but it is the norm now. The implicit message to the sinner is: <i>Your behavior is unfortunate, but not dire. We assume you are still saved; just try to do better.</i>

It is worth highlighting that **not all evangelical voices have remained silent**. Here and there, individuals have decried this trend. For example, missionary-evangelist Paul Washer rebuked modern churches by saying that by **“not preaching on sin, we have done a great injustice to the gospel”** (from *The Cross* sermon). The late revivalist Leonard Ravenhill used to lament that **“the altar calls are full but the alters are empty”**, meaning many respond emotionally but few truly repent and forsake sin. These prophetic voices, however, tend to be admired from afar rather than imitated. The mainstream methodology rolls on, emphasizing **positive affirmation over warnings**. One might attend evangelical conferences, listen to popular Christian radio, or read best-selling Christian books and scarcely ever hear the old echoes of *“If you live according to the flesh, you will die”* (Rom. 8:13) or *“Let no one deceive you… the immoral, impure, or greedy… has no inheritance in the kingdom”* (Eph. 5:5–6). Such verses are in every Bible, but they have almost become the “quiet parts” we don’t say out loud.
## <a name="_toc197890394"></a>Contrast with the Early Church’s Frank Admonitions
**How different is this from the early church!** The Christians of the first centuries, including the New Testament authors, **did not hesitate to link immoral conduct with eternal destiny** in their preaching and teaching. Far from assuming that every baptized person would make it to heaven regardless of behavior, they frequently warned believers of the real possibility of falling away and facing judgment.

In the New Testament itself, we see Paul writing to the <b>Corinthian church</b>, a community of baptized believers, reminding them bluntly: <i>“Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers… will inherit the kingdom of God.”[<sup>bible.com</sup></i>](https://www.bible.com/bible/100/1CO.6.9-10.NASB1995#:~:text=Or%20do%20you%20not%20know,inherit%20the%20kingdom%20of%20God)</i>. This “do not be deceived” implies that Christians <b>are in danger of deceiving themselves on this point</b>—thinking perhaps that grace gives them a pass. Paul will have none of it. He effectively says: make no mistake, if you practice these sins, you will not be saved. Similarly, the author of Hebrews includes himself among believers when he warns, <i>“If we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a terrifying expectation of judgment”</i> (Heb. 10:26–27). Such language was meant to instill <b>godly fear</b> and prompt self-examination.

Early post-biblical writings continue in the same vein. The <i>Didache</i> (c. A.D. 70-90), a church manual for new converts, urged Christians to be ever watchful, for, <i>“the whole time of your faith will not profit you, if you are not made complete in the last time.”[<sup>earlychristianwritings.com</sup></i>](https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/didache-roberts.html#:~:text=Chapter%2016,do%20signs%20and%20wonders%2C%20and)</i> In other words, it’s not how you start but how you finish; early faith means nothing if one falls away before the end. The <i>Shepherd of Hermas</i> (late 1st or mid-2nd century), an immensely popular Christian text in its time, teaches that those believers who <b>do not repent of their sins “shall utterly perish,”</b> and even one who has entered the church but “relapse[s]” into strife and disunity <i>“will be cast out of the tower [the Church], and will lose his life.”</i> It concludes, <b>“Life is the possession of all who keep the commandments of the Lord.”[<i><sup>catholic.com</sup></i>](https://www.catholic.com/tract/mortal-sin#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAnd%20as%20many%20of%20them,A.D.%2080)</b>. Note that keeping the Lord’s commandments (i.e. obeying Him) is seen as the condition for retaining “life” (salvation). That is a far cry from <i>“you can sin like the devil and not lose your salvation”</i>.

St. <b>Justin Martyr</b> (c. 156 AD) wrote that <i>“eternal fire was prepared for him who <b>voluntarily departed</b> from God, and for all who, <b>without repentance, persevere in apostasy</b>.”[<sup>catholic.com</sup></i>](https://www.catholic.com/tract/mortal-sin#:~:text=Justin%20Martyr)</i>. Here a Church Father teaches clearly that someone who had been with God (a Christian) can depart voluntarily and end up in eternal fire if they persist in that state without repentance. This shows the early Christians firmly believed a true believer <b>could indeed walk away and be lost</b>. Even the theologian Augustine, often cited by later Calvinists, taught that many receive God’s grace initially but do not persevere to the end (he distinguished between initial grace and the gift of perseverance). The early church simply <b>did not share the modern security-complacency</b>; they considered the race of faith something one could fail to finish.

They also implemented <b>church discipline</b> for moral sins, something often missing now. For example, if a man in the early church was found to be using prostitutes or indulging sexual immorality (like the man in 1 Corinthians 5 who had to be expelled), he would be removed from fellowship, not coddled. Repentance was often formal and at times lengthy. Tertullian (c. 203 AD) remarks how some, out of shame, <i>“put off [confessing their sin] from day to day… and thus they perish along with their own bashfulness”[<sup>catholic.com</sup></i>](https://www.catholic.com/tract/mortal-sin#:~:text=Tertullian)</i>. The assumption is that <b>refusing to repent and confess sin leads to spiritual perishing</b>. Contrast that with today, where one might sit in church for years with a hidden porn addiction and never be confronted or even directly challenged from the pulpit to confess and repent—or risk perishing.

Early Christian leaders spoke of certain grave sins (later termed “mortal sins”) that would <b>kill the life of grace in the soul</b> if not absolved. They didn’t delineate these out of legalism, but because they saw the spiritual devastation such sins caused. The concept of <b>“mortal sin”</b> – a sin that, if willfully continued, results in spiritual death – was universally accepted. As one summary puts it, <i>“The early Church Fathers were unanimous in teaching the reality of mortal sin… they recognized that it was possible to lose the grace of salvation after baptism.”[<sup>catholic.com](https://www.catholic.com/tract/mortal-sin#:~:text=Fortunately%2C%20most%20Christians%20today%20reject,the%20reality%20of%20mortal%20sin)[catholic.com</i></sup>](https://www.catholic.com/tract/mortal-sin#:~:text=They%20had%20to%20embrace%20the,grace%20of%20salvation%20after%20baptism)</i>. This was simply taken for granted in discipleship: a baptized believer who later committed idolatry, sexual immorality, or murder, for example, would be understood to have cut themselves off from Christ and must be restored only through sincere repentance (if at all). No one would argue “perhaps he was never really saved”; they would focus on the clear fact that he is in peril <i>now</i> and needs to return to grace.

One vivid illustration of how seriously sin was taken is the practice in some early communities of allowing *one* post-baptismal repentance for major sins (a view associated with Hermas and later Novatian rigorists). While the broader church did not dogmatically limit repentance, the very existence of that idea shows how costly a second fall was considered. Today’s church, by contrast, often treats repeated falls into egregious sin as almost expected, endlessly saying “we’re all broken” without urgently calling for transformation. **The early Christians feared sin; many modern Christians merely fret about it.**

Perhaps most telling is the tone of **urgency and eternity** in early Christian exhortations. **They constantly had eternity in view.** Modern preaching, by softening warnings, has largely shifted the focus to the here-and-now benefits of Christianity (peace, purpose, community) rather than the stark realities of heaven and hell. The early church could not afford such complacency; they faced persecution, and they believed deeply that **to deny Christ—whether under pressure or for worldly pleasure—was to imperil one’s soul.** They heeded Jesus’ own words: *“Whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father”* (Matt. 10:33). They remembered that even an anointed figure like King David, had he not repented of his adultery and murder, would have been lost. Thus, they wove warnings into their teaching naturally.

We see, then, a **dramatic divergence**: The early church **majored on holiness and warnings** while still offering grace to the repentant; much of the modern church **majors on positional grace and neglects to warn**, assuming (often wrongly) that warnings are implicitly understood. The result? **A churchgoer in A.D. 150 likely knew that falling into serious sin without repentance meant damnation**, whereas a churchgoer in 2025 might think falling into serious sin will merely reduce their joy or rewards—but not endanger their salvation.
## <a name="_toc197890395"></a>The Cost of Diminished Warnings
What is at stake with this modern diminution? **Souls are at stake.** If Scripture is to be believed, there are people now in our churches who, barring repentance, **“must expect the lake of fire”** (Rev. 21:8) despite their profession of faith. But because they have been given continual assurances and scant warnings, they continue comfortably in sin, **mistaking God’s patience for license**. The cost is both individual and corporate:

- **Individual danger:** A man addicted to pornography in a church that never warns of hell for such behavior may never come to godly sorrow. He may compare himself to others (“everyone struggles”) and wait for sanctification to “happen” without drastic action. If he never breaks free and dies in unrepentance, the Bible’s sober verdict is that he will not inherit the Kingdom (1 Cor. 6:9–10). How tragic if he goes to judgment saying, “But I was told I was saved…” The very phrase “do not be deceived” (used by Paul regarding these sins) implies the possibility of tragic self-deception. **The church that fails to warn has, in effect, not loved this man’s soul.**
- **Corporate impurity:** When warnings diminish, **sin flourishes in the church’s midst**, weakening its witness and grieving the Holy Spirit. Churches become numerically large but spiritually anemic—*“having a form of godliness but denying its power”* (2 Tim. 3:5). Sexual scandals among clergy, ethical failures, and the rampant secret sins of members all thrive in an environment where **the fear of God is absent**. Early Christians were known for their striking purity in a decadent world; many modern churches are almost indistinguishable from the world in conduct. This diminishes the glory of Christ’s church before unbelievers.
- **False assurance:** Perhaps the greatest cost is that **false assurance replaces true assurance.** True assurance is based on *both* the promise of God and the evidence of a transformed life. Diminished warnings sever the second component. People cling to a promise divorced from its moral context. John’s epistle gives tests (e.g. “we know that we have come to know Him if we keep His commandments” – 1 John 2:3). Remove those tests, and you get nominal Christians feeling very secure, while truly devout souls (who might need comfort) sometimes unnecessarily doubt because all the warnings they *do* see in Scripture are being explained away by others. It’s an ironic twist: **those who shouldn’t feel safe, do; and those who strive for holiness, fearing the Lord, often get little encouragement** because the church at large is awkward about the whole topic of assurance and holy fear.

The **moral and spiritual anemia** of the Western church today can be traced, in part, to this imbalance. We preach *half* the truth (grace, love, security) but not the *other half* (holiness, fear, conditional warnings). But half-truths can behave like lies in practice. Jesus and the apostles did not shy from putting conditions and warnings next to promises. *“If by the Spirit you are putting to death the deeds of the body, you will live”* (Rom. 8:13) — which logically implies if you *aren’t*, you will die. Such clarity jolts the soul into action. If that clarity is consistently missing from our pulpits, **we inadvertently encourage spiritual laziness and compromise.**

As a result, many professing believers today live in a tragic state that one author called **“unsaved Christians”** – people who think themselves Christians but are not regenerate or are on the road of apostasy. They may **“name the name of Christ,” but depart not from iniquity”** (cf. 2 Tim. 2:19). They believe they’re headed for heaven, even as they march toward hell. And the church’s silence or softness confirms them in that delusion. This should break our hearts and spur us to recover the full counsel of God.
## <a name="_toc197890396"></a>Recovering the Early Church’s Balance
To address this modern shortfall, we must reclaim the **apostolic balance of comfort and warning**. After all, the same Paul who told believers nothing could separate them from Christ’s love (Rom. 8:38–39) also told believers to “work out your salvation with fear and trembling” (Phil. 2:12). The early church managed to preach both. We can too, but it requires conviction and courage.

First, pastors and teachers must **firmly believe what the Scriptures say about the eternal stakes**. We must accept that warnings addressed to believers are not hypothetical. They are meant to be taken at face value: if *we* (born-again, Spirit-filled people) live after the flesh, *we* will die (Rom. 8:13); if *we* deny Him, *He will deny us* (2 Tim. 2:12); if *we* do not persevere, *we* will not inherit the promise (Heb. 10:36–39). Once church leaders let these truths grip them personally, they can preach with authenticity.

Second, our preaching and teaching should regularly include loving warnings alongside invitations. This need not be done with an angry or judgmental tone; it can be done tearfully, pleading like Paul who warned the Ephesian elders for *“three years… night and day with tears”* (Acts 20:31). Warnings actually **strengthen** the impact of grace. When people grasp the danger of sin, the **grace of forgiveness and power to overcome sin becomes all the more amazing**. In eras of revival, preachers like John Wesley or Charles Finney would convict the conscience with God’s law and warnings, then offer the sweet gospel solution. That pattern produces true converts who flee from sin to Christ, rather than half-converts who merely add Christ to their sin.

Third, churches should consider restoring **church discipline and accountability** structures, particularly regarding pervasive issues like pornography. When 50-70% of the men (and many women) in a congregation are ensnared in a sin that Scripture says can bar one from the Kingdom, something is terribly wrong. It calls for a radical, public response—special times of repentance, accountability groups, pastoral oversight of those struggling, perhaps even withholding leadership roles or membership privileges until repentance is evident (always in a spirit of restoration, per Gal. 6:1). This is uncomfortable, yes. But which is worse: to discomfort people now, or for them to hear on Judgment Day, *“I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness”* (Matt. 7:23)? The early Christians chose temporary discomfort (confession, penance, discipline) to avert eternal tragedy. We should do the same, guided by Scripture and love.

Finally, we as a modern church must repent for our **“Laodicean”** lukewarmness. Jesus rebuked the church at Laodicea for thinking they were rich and in need of nothing, not realizing they were wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked (Rev. 3:15–17). In many ways, that is us. We assume all is well because our churches are full and programs running. But if we have lost the *saline edge* of holiness and the *fire* of urgency, we are lukewarm. Jesus’ counsel to Laodicea was to *“be zealous and repent”* (Rev. 3:19). We can take that to heart. We must repent of fearing man more than God, repent of the laziness that let difficult doctrines slide, and repent of the lack of love that failed to warn our brothers and sisters of danger.

**Modern diminution of warnings is not irreversible.** Already, there are signs of some awakening. Some ministries now speak frankly about pornography and call for purity. Some pastors are re-preaching neglected texts about judgment. Believers disillusioned with shallow Christianity are reading the early Church Fathers and discovering that robust call to holiness. These are hopeful signs. Yet much more is needed for a broad course-correction.

In conclusion, the church today finds itself at a pivotal moment similar to the Old Testament watchman on the wall (Ezekiel 33). God told Ezekiel that if the watchman sees the sword coming and fails to blow the trumpet, the people’s blood will be on the watchman’s head. But if he blows the warning and any refuse to heed, then he is not guilty of their blood. Right now, **the swords of sin and judgment are drawn against the church from within and without.** Many leaders have not blown the trumpet of warning for fear of disturbing the peace. This chapter has attempted to show the deadly folly of that approach. **We must blow the trumpet clearly once again.** We must declare to the baptized: *“Brothers and sisters, make no mistake—those who practice sexual immorality, impurity, greed, deceit, etc., will not inherit God’s kingdom. If you have fallen into these, flee from the wrath to come by fleeing to Christ anew in repentance!”* This is not contrary to the gospel; it *is part of* the gospel call.

By restoring these warnings about sin after conversion, we actually honor the true grace of God. For as the apostle Paul wrote to Titus, *“the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all people, **instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires** and to live sensibly, righteously and godly in the present age”* (Titus 2:11–12, emphasis added). Grace instructs us to deny sin, not to tolerate it. **Modern preaching must reconnect grace with its instructing, transforming power.** In doing so, the church will regain the holy vibrancy of its first love, speaking with one voice the full counsel of God: promise and warning, mercy and judgment, comfort and challenge. With the air thus cleared, those who persist in sin will hear the alarm and have the opportunity to truly repent, and those who are walking in the light will be sobered and all the more watchful to remain faithful. This sets the stage for the next chapter, which moves from diagnosis to prescription: a direct **call to repentance and hope** for all who have found themselves ensnared in sin’s web, and a roadmap to restoration for the wandering soul.

# Chapter 6: Call to Repentance and Hope
**Abstract:** Having established the peril of continued sin for believers, this chapter issues a direct and pastoral **call to repentance coupled with genuine hope.** It begins by unpacking Romans 6 and Titus 2:11–14 (NASB) to show that God’s grace not only saves but also empowers believers to **die to sin and live righteously**. The message is sober: anyone **practicing sins like pornography or other sexual immorality must expect the lake of fire unless they thoroughly repent and are delivered**. Yet alongside this warning, the chapter emphasizes that **immediate and complete repentance, enabled by God’s power, can restore the worst sinner**. True repentance is described in practical terms—renouncing sin, confessing openly, and pursuing holiness with endurance to the end. Drawing on the model of the early church, the chapter avoids modern therapeutic counsel and instead encourages classical spiritual disciplines of self-examination, fasting, and accountability within the community. It also provides concrete aids: a suggested liturgy of repentance (with prayers and Scripture readings) that individuals or congregations can use, and reflection questions for personal application. The tone remains both **academic and devotional**—grounded in Scripture and theological truth, yet warm and encouraging, assuring readers that **no one who genuinely turns from sin to God will be cast out.** In a world of compromise, this chapter aims to rekindle a holy urgency and a joyful hope in the soul that responds to God’s call: **“Repent… and live!”**
## <a name="_toc197890398"></a>Grace and Judgment Hand in Hand
A church that reclaims the **warnings of Scripture** must also loudly proclaim the **hope of the gospel**: that no sinner who turns to Christ in truth will be turned away, and that God’s grace is sufficient not only to forgive but to *transform*. This hope, however, shines brightest against the dark backdrop of judgment. Therefore, we begin by affirming both: **the fate of the unrepentant and the promise to the repentant.** It is a grave truth that anyone indulging in pornography or other willful sins is, at present, on a trajectory toward the lake of fire (Rev. 21:8). It is an equally glorious truth that if that person repents—thoroughly and genuinely—they will find mercy and the power to live a new life.

The Apostle Paul masterfully holds grace and judgment together in his teaching. In <b>Romans 6</b>, after explaining that we are justified by faith and under grace, he anticipates a possible misunderstanding. He asks: <i>“What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin so that grace may increase?”</i> and he answers emphatically, <i>“Far from it! How shall we who died to sin still live in it?”[<sup>biblehub.com</sup></i>](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/romans/6.htm#:~:text=1%20What%20shall%20we%20say,resurrection%2C%20%2010knowing%20this%2C%20that)</i>. Here Paul affirms a crucial doctrinal and experiential reality: those united to Christ have <i>died to sin</i>. This isn’t flowery language—it’s a statement of fact. When we truly came to Christ, something in us fundamentally changed: our old self was crucified with Him <i>“so that we would no longer be slaves to sin.”[<sup>biblehub.com</sup></i>](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/romans/6.htm#:~:text=through%20the%20glory%20of%20the,f%5Dfreed%20from%20sin)</i> If we grasp this truth, it radically changes our perspective. <b>A Christian continuing in known sin is not just doing something naughty; it is a contradiction of their very identity</b>. Paul essentially says, “You can’t live in sin—you died to it. It no longer owns you.” This is both a theological declaration and a moral imperative.

<b>Romans 6</b> proceeds to counsel the believer: <i>“Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its lusts”[<sup>biblehub.com</sup></i>](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/romans/6.htm#:~:text=12%20Therefore%20sin%20is%20not,the%20Law%20but%20under%20grace)</i>. This implies that if we <i>do</i> let sin reign, we are disobeying a direct order and reverting to an authority (sin) that has no right to rule us. Paul warns that presenting ourselves to sin leads to slavery and <b>“resulting in death”[<i><sup>biblehub.com</sup></i>](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/romans/6.htm#:~:text=15%20What%20then%3F%20Are%20we,because%20of%20the%20weakness%20of)</b>, whereas presenting ourselves to obedience leads to righteousness. We see here the stakes: <b>continued obedience to sin results in (eternal) death</b>. There’s no soft-pedaling. But then Paul pivots to hope: <i>“But thanks be to God that though you were slaves of sin, you became obedient from the heart… and having been freed from sin, you became slaves of righteousness.”</i> (Rom. 6:17–18). This is the hopeful reality we must embrace: <b>in Christ, freedom from sin’s dominion is not only an ideal—it is an operative truth</b>. We <i>were</i> slaves; now we are free to obey God. We have a new master, righteousness, which leads to sanctification and “the outcome, eternal life” (Rom. 6:22). The famous verse that concludes the chapter reminds us of both sides: <i>“For the wages of sin is death, but the gracious gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”</i> (Rom. 6:23). Notice, this is addressed to believers, summarizing Paul’s whole argument. If a Christian yields to sin, they earn death (the same fate as an unbeliever), but if they abide in Christ, eternal life is theirs as a gift. <b>Grace does not eliminate wages; it provides a way to escape the wages through union with Christ.</b>

So, dear reader, consider your own life. **Have you been using grace as an excuse to sin?** Perhaps not consciously, but subtly? Romans 6 challenges us: if you think you can carry on with pornography (or any willful sin) because God is gracious, you are twisting grace into a license, which Scripture forbids (Jude 4). The truth is that *grace united you to Christ’s death and resurrection*. If you truly partake of Christ, you have power to renounce that sin. This is both sobering (no excuse for sin) and incredibly hopeful (sin’s power *is* broken in Christ!). It’s a call to *action*: *“consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ”* (Rom. 6:11). That means we actively reckon in our minds: “I do not have to obey this lust. In Christ I am alive to God, and dead to this behavior.” This reckoning is part of repentance—aligning our mindset with God’s truth.

While Romans 6 gives the doctrinal backbone, <b>Titus 2:11–14</b> gives a concise, beautiful picture of grace-enabled living. It says: <i>“For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all people, <b>instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires</b> and to live sensibly, righteously, and in a godly manner in the present age”[<sup>biblegateway.com</sup></i>](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus%202&version=NASB#:~:text=11%C2%A0For%20the%20grace%20of%20God,AA%29eager%20for%20good%20deeds)</i>. Note that grace <i>instructs</i> us—some translations say “trains us” or “teaches us.” Grace is like a teacher schooling us in a new way of life. It doesn’t pat us on the head and say, “There, there, continue as you were.” No, grace takes us firmly in hand and drills us in the disciplines of denying ungodliness. <b>Pornography, lust, dishonesty, drunkenness—these are “worldly desires”</b> that grace commands us to renounce. By the grace of God (and only by His grace) can we say “No” to these passions effectively. The same grace then trains us to live self-controlled (“sensibly”), upright (“righteously”), and godly lives <i>now</i>, even before we reach heaven. This counters the notion some have that we only expect to be free from sin in glory. Paul insists that grace is effective <b>“in the present age”[<i><sup>biblegateway.com</sup></i>](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus%202&version=NASB#:~:text=11%C2%A0For%20the%20grace%20of%20God,AA%29eager%20for%20good%20deeds)</b>. Yes, we still battle sin daily, but we battle <i>from victory</i>, not from utter defeat. We can make real progress; we can experience real purity of heart and mind by God’s grace.

Titus 2:13–14 goes on to root this in Christ’s work: <i>“looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus, who <b>gave Himself for us to redeem us from every lawless deed</b>, and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good deeds.”[<sup>biblegateway.com</sup></i>](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus%202&version=NASB#:~:text=11%C2%A0For%20the%20grace%20of%20God,AA%29eager%20for%20good%20deeds)</i>. Reflect on that: Jesus did not just give Himself to forgive the guilt of our lawless deeds; He died to <b>redeem us from those deeds themselves</b> – to buy us out of bondage to lawlessness. His goal is a purified people, eager to do what is good. <b>If we remain wallowing in lawless deeds (like viewing porn, committing adultery in the heart), we are frustrating the very purpose of Christ’s death.</b> That is serious. But conversely, it means <i>deliverance is fully possible</i> because Christ intended it. He <b>“gave Himself”</b> with our complete sanctification in view. This ought to inject tremendous hope into the struggling sinner: <i>Christ is invested in my purity. He died for this very thing—to break these chains off me.</i> You are not left to your own strength; the Lord has a stake in your freedom from sin.

Thus, grace and judgment are not enemies; they are friends. The warning of judgment (if we persist in sin, we die) should drive us to cling to grace and avail ourselves of its power. And the true grace of God always directs us away from sin, never into it.

At this juncture, then, let us state clearly the twin truths this chapter presses: <b>(1) Anyone practicing sins like pornography, sexual immorality, and the like, without repentance, must expect that if they continue on that path, their destiny will be the lake of fire (the second death).</b> This is in line with Scriptures such as <i>Revelation 21:8</i>, which includes “the sexually immoral” among those whose <i>“part will be in the lake that burns with fire”</i>. No amount of prior religious experience or knowledge will shield one who <b>“practices sin”</b> deliberately. The Bible says <i>“Do not be deceived,”</i> do not think you’re the exception[<i><sup>bible.com</sup></i>](https://www.bible.com/bible/100/1CO.6.9-10.NASB1995#:~:text=Or%20do%20you%20not%20know,inherit%20the%20kingdom%20of%20God). (2) <b>If that same person repents—truly turns from sin to God—they will be saved, cleansed, and kept by God’s power unto salvation.</b> There is absolutely no sin too great for God’s mercy in Christ. As proof, Scripture reminds even egregious sinners who repent: <i>“Such were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified…”[<sup>biblegateway.com</sup></i>](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/1%20Corinthians%206%3A11#:~:text=match%20at%20L364%20And%20such,the%20Spirit%20of%20our%20God)</i>. The church at Corinth had ex-fornicators, ex-adulterers, even ex-idolaters and homosexuals. They <i>were</i> those things, but by repentance and faith they were washed and made new. <b>No one who genuinely repents is beyond hope.</b>

It is the duty of the church to deliver both messages together: *“If you continue in sin, you will perish”* and *“If you repent and trust Christ, you will be forgiven and transformed.”* Let us now turn to what true repentance entails, and how one might pursue it earnestly, drawing on God’s promised help.
## <a name="_toc197890399"></a>Dying to Sin: Lessons from Romans 6
True repentance begins with a kind of **death**. This sounds frightening, but it is a blessed death: **death to sin, death to the old self**. Romans 6, as we saw, teaches that every Christian has died with Christ. Repentance is essentially **bringing our life into alignment with that death**. It is *acting out* what is already positionally true: “I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me” (Gal. 2:20). When a believer who has fallen into sin comes under conviction, the path forward is to **embrace the cross anew**—to agree with God that “the old me” (the porn-watching me, the lying me, the angry me, etc.) deserves to die, and through Christ *has died*.

What does this look like practically? It means a complete and unreserved yielding of oneself to God. Paul said, <i>“do not go on presenting the parts of your body to sin as instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead”[<sup>biblehub.com</sup></i>](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/romans/6.htm#:~:text=12%20Therefore%20sin%20is%20not,the%20Law%20but%20under%20grace)</i>. If you are repenting of sexual sin, for example, you consciously yield your eyes to God (to bounce them away from lustful images), your hands to God (to use your computer/phone for good, not evil), your mind to God (to take captive lustful thoughts in obedience to Christ). And you do this not in a merely ritualistic way, but <b>“from the heart”</b>, out of love for the God who saved you (Rom. 6:17).

Dying to sin also involves a kind of warfare, a violent renunciation. Colossians 3:5 urges, *“Therefore consider the members of your earthly body as dead to immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire…”* The old term is “mortify” (put to death) these things. **Repentance is not anemic; it is vigorous.** Jesus said if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out; if your hand causes sin, cut it off (Matt. 5:29–30). That imagery tells us repentance may require **drastic action**. If internet pornography is your snare, “pluck out the eye” might mean getting rid of your smartphone or installing strict accountability filters and giving someone else the password. It might mean literally disconnecting your home internet for a season, if that’s what it takes. Some would call that extreme; Jesus calls it better to lose those conveniences than to be cast into hell. If a dating relationship is pulling you into sexual sin, repentance likely means ending that relationship. If certain friends entice you to drink or do drugs, repentance means cutting off those friendships (at least until you are strong enough to influence them rather than be influenced). **These choices feel like a kind of death—death to self, death to comfort, death to what our flesh enjoys.** But they lead to life.

Romans 6:16 adds a profound insight: <i>“Do you not know that when you present yourselves to someone as slaves for obedience, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin <b>resulting in death</b>, or of obedience <b>resulting in righteousness</b>?”[<sup>biblehub.com</sup></i>](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/romans/6.htm#:~:text=15%20What%20then%3F%20Are%20we,because%20of%20the%20weakness%20of)</i>. Paul personifies Sin and Obedience as two masters. We have a choice whom to offer ourselves to. Continuing in sin is not a neutral or lesser choice—it’s choosing a master who pays in death. Repentance is choosing obedience as our new master (which, we know, is really yielding to God as Master). The <i>result</i> of consistent obedience is increasing righteousness, which means a character conformed to Christ. This is a litmus test: <b>If we are truly repentant, we will consistently choose obedience over sin going forward</b>. Not that we become sinlessly perfect overnight, but our trajectory and loyalty change. We switch sides in the war. We stop making excuses and start making war on our sins.

One might ask, *“But what if I have repented before and then fallen again? Is my repentance real? Can I truly die to sin when it seems to keep reviving?”* This is a crucial pastoral question. The answer is twofold: First, we should never make peace with sin on the grounds that “I always fall.” That is fatalism, not faith. The righteous may fall seven times and rise again (Prov. 24:16), yes, but he rises to continue the fight. So even if you have fallen a hundred times, **the call now is to repent *again*** — but more deeply and resolutely than ever before, learning from past failures. Second, examine *why* the past attempts failed. Sometimes what we called “repentance” was merely **remorse or half-measures**. Perhaps after indulging you felt bad and told God “I’m sorry,” but took no serious steps to remove the opportunity to sin. That’s not full repentance. Or perhaps you repented sincerely, but you neglected to fill the void with seeking God (you only tried to not sin, which left you vulnerable). True repentance is both **“putting off”** the old and **“putting on”** the new (Eph. 4:22–24). You can’t just stop looking at porn; you must start investing in prayer, Scripture, serving others—so that your life is filled with righteousness, leaving less room for the flesh.

Romans 6 encourages us that slavery to righteousness **grows** on us: *“Just as you used to offer yourselves to impurity... **resulting in further lawlessness**, so now offer yourselves to righteousness, **resulting in sanctification**.”* (Rom. 6:19). Sin tends to snowball (one sin leads to more). But likewise, acts of obedience and devotion snowball into greater sanctification. The more we obey, the easier obedience becomes; holy habits replace sinful habits. This is hopeful for someone struggling: start the momentum of obedience, even if small, and watch it gain strength by God’s grace.

Therefore, **dying to sin in repentance is both a decisive crisis and an ongoing process.** There is a decisive moment (or moments) where you say before God, “Enough! I renounce this evil. I belong to Christ.” That is where, spiritually, the “death” is reckoned. Then, each day, you carry the cross by reinforcing that decision—*“I die daily”* as Paul says (1 Cor. 15:31)—making choices consistent with your initial surrender. In practical terms, an actually repentant person doesn’t plan to sin anymore. They plan not to. They install safeguards, they seek accountability, they restructure their routines to avoid known pitfalls. If one simply says “sorry” after sin but changes nothing, it is likely **worldly sorrow** (feeling bad about consequences) rather than **godly sorrow** (feeling the offense against God and determining to change) (see 2 Cor. 7:10). Godly sorrow leads to repentance *“without regret, leading to salvation”*, and Paul describes it as producing *“earnestness… vindication… indignation… fear… longing… zeal… avenging of wrong”* (2 Cor. 7:11). These are the emotions of someone who has *died* to their sin: they are earnest (serious now), eager to clear themselves, indignant at their sin, fearful of grieving God, longing to be restored fully, zealous to do right, and eager to see justice (even accepting consequences). This is a helpful biblical checklist for our hearts. True repentance is *not* casual.

However, we must stress: **this death to sin is impossible on our own.** It is only by union with Christ’s death and by the power of the Holy Spirit that we can carry it out. That is why any practical step we take must be done in prayerful dependence. If you dump your whiskey bottles out, do it praying, “Lord, in Your strength I cast this away—sustain me.” If you cancel the internet, do it saying, “Jesus, You are more precious to me than any convenience.” Repentance divorced from reliance on God can become self-righteous asceticism. But repentance *with* reliance becomes a sweet offering to God and a doorway to deeper intimacy with Him.

In summary, **Romans 6 teaches us that believers are dead to sin and alive to God.** Our call in repentance is to live out that reality: consider it true, present ourselves to God, and refuse any longer to let sin reign. **It is a fight unto death—sin’s death, not ours—and Christ has assured victory to those who fight in His strength.**
## <a name="_toc197890400"></a>The Grace That Disciplines: Titus 2:11–14
As we continue to flesh out repentance, let’s revisit **Titus 2:11–14** to understand how God’s grace actually works in training us for holiness. Many have a truncated view of grace, seeing it only as unmerited favor that forgives. But in Titus we see grace as an active teacher. The Greek term for “instructing” has the connotation of disciplining or child-training. Grace, in a sense, **“disciples” us with both encouragement and correction**.

Imagine grace personified as a wise mentor in your life. When you repent and yield to God, grace comes alongside to show you the new way. Grace says, “No, my child, don’t go to those websites or dwell on those images—that’s not who you are now. Yes, it will hurt a bit to deny yourself, but I will comfort you with better joys.” Grace also says, “Here, feed on the Word of God; let’s replace those old thoughts with God’s promises and commands. Let’s set a new routine: when you feel tempted, pray or call a brother in Christ.” Grace says, “Get up, morning by morning, and present yourself to God anew—I will supply the strength.” In other words, **grace empowers the practical disciplines that keep us from falling back.** This might include daily prayer, Scripture meditation, involvement in a supportive Christian community, and even things like fasting to subdue the flesh. All these are not “works” to earn salvation; they are *means of grace* to train us in godliness.

One might ask, how do I rely on grace and not slip into self-effort? The key difference is in the heart’s posture. If I engage in repentance and subsequent discipline with an attitude of *“I will fix myself by my effort,”* that is self-reliance. If instead my attitude is *“Lord, I’m obeying and putting to death the deeds of the body **by the Spirit** (Rom. 8:13), trusting You to enable and change me,”* that is relying on grace. Externally the actions might look similar (cutting off avenues to sin, praying regularly, etc.), but internally one is fueled by pride or fear and the other by faith and love.

Titus 2:12 specifically notes grace trains us to deny “ungodliness.” Ungodliness is a general term for irreverence or living without regard for God. When someone views pornography, in that moment they are living *as if God did not see or matter*. It’s profoundly ungodly. Grace teaches us to live *consciously before God’s face* in everything (“Coram Deo” as the Reformers said). A huge part of repentance is learning to cultivate the **fear of the Lord** — not a slavish terror that He’ll smite us arbitrarily, but a reverent awareness that *“God is here, I cannot sin in His presence without grieving Him.”* Grace, oddly enough, produces this fear. As Titus said, Jesus “gave Himself to redeem us” — when we contemplate the cross, where grace poured out, we actually feel a greater horror of sin (because that’s what made the cross necessary) and a greater love for righteousness (because that’s what Jesus died to secure). So if you want to fuel repentance, **meditate on the cross of Christ**. See His agony for your lust, your lies, your pride. Let it break your heart and simultaneously heal it. This is the discipline of grace: it softens our heart so that obedience is drawn out by love, not merely driven by duty.

Another aspect Titus highlights is **“looking for the blessed hope… the glory of Christ”** (2:13). Grace keeps our eyes on the future – the return of Jesus and our eternal life with Him. Why is this important for repentance? Because sin often offers immediate gratification at the expense of future joy. Pornography, for example, gives a quick illicit thrill but steals the capacity for genuine intimacy and ultimately jeopardizes eternal joy. Grace reminds us of the *“surpassing value of knowing Christ”* (Phil. 3:8) and the coming glory. It reorients our reward system: we learn to say, “I forego the cheap pleasure now because I am waiting for a far greater pleasure – the smile of my Savior, a pure heart, the inheritance of the saints.” Moses exemplified this, as Hebrews 11:25–26 says, *“choosing rather to endure ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin, considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; **for he was looking to the reward**.”* We need that eternal perspective. It is notable how seldom eternity is mentioned in many churches today except at funerals. We must become *eternity-minded* again, because it is a powerful motivator to holiness. Living in light of the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10-11) is healthy for the soul—Paul said *“Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men”*, including persuading men to repent and live righteously.

Grace also instills <b>zeal</b>. Jesus redeemed a people <i>“zealous for good deeds”[<sup>biblegateway.com</sup></i>](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus%202&version=NASB#:~:text=11%C2%A0For%20the%20grace%20of%20God,AA%29eager%20for%20good%20deeds)</i>. A truly repentant person doesn’t just stop doing bad; they become eager to do good. This is a sign of heart change: you move from apathy or reluctance about spiritual things to a zeal—maybe even what others call fanaticism—for holiness, evangelism, serving others, etc. It is vital to replace the mental and time-space that sin occupied with positive pursuits. For instance, if someone spent hours every week on pornography, those hours need reallocation—perhaps to ministry, to physical exercise, to learning a skill, to volunteering, to prayer meetings. Idleness is often the devil’s playground. Grace teaches us to fill our lives with fruitful labor in the Lord such that the appeal of sin diminishes. <b>An idle Christian is a vulnerable Christian</b>. The Victorian preacher Charles Spurgeon once said, “If you are idle in Christ’s work, you are active in the devil’s work.” Strong words, but they ring true.

Let’s put this plainly for someone struggling: **if you repent, God’s grace will not leave you alone to muddle through.** The Holy Spirit, the Spirit of grace, will actively work in you. You will find new desires awakening—perhaps a hunger for Scripture like never before, or an urge to make restitution for past wrongs, or a compassion for others in sin. Follow those impulses of the Spirit. They are part of His training. Conversely, if you attempt to repent but neglect the means of grace (prayer, Word, fellowship), you effectively cut yourself off from the fuel needed to sustain repentance. It’s like trying to run a marathon without eating. Many a Christian has “burned out” trying to fight sin in isolation from God; eventually the willpower fails. Don’t let that happen—**stay plugged into grace’s power through communion with God**.

To summarize, Titus shows grace as the initiator and sustainer of a holy life. We renounce ungodliness *by grace*, we live uprightly *by grace*, looking to Jesus’s return *by grace*, and do good works *by grace*. This should keep us both humble (we can’t boast in our repentance as if we did it) and confident (we’re not in this battle alone; Almighty God is at work in us mightily).
## <a name="_toc197890401"></a>If You Continue, You Shall Perish: The Stakes of Unrepentant Sin
Even as we revel in the hope of repentance, it is necessary to keep the **alternative outcome** crystal clear: continuing in willful sin will absolutely lead to damnation. This is the **terrifying reality** that should shock the sinner out of complacency. Sometimes, after repeated failures, a person starts to think, “Maybe God will just have to take me as I am; I can’t change.” That thought must be confronted with the sobering truth: *“No, if I refuse to change (repent), I will be lost.”*

The **“lake of fire”** (Rev. 20:15, 21:8) is not an outdated scare tactic; it is a biblical revelation of the final destiny of the unredeemed. Jesus spoke of it as “Gehenna” or outer darkness, a place of weeping and gnashing of teeth. He taught that at the end of the age, He will separate the wicked from the righteous, and the wicked will go *“into the eternal fire”* (Matt. 25:41). Importantly, Jesus did not exclude professing believers from this warning. In fact, some of his most dire warnings were given to disciples. He said, *“Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, [the Father] takes away… such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned”* (John 15:2,6). This demolishes the notion that being “in Him” at one time guarantees eternal immunity. A branch must continue to bear fruit (evidence of living faith) or else be cut off.

For those dabbling in sin, Scriptures like these must be taken to heart. **We must personalize the warning**: “If *I* live after the flesh, *I* will die” (Rom. 8:13). It is not judging others to apply it to oneself. Paul included himself in *“if we deny Him, He will deny us”* (2 Tim. 2:12). Let’s not imagine we are above falling. *“Let anyone who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall”* (1 Cor. 10:12).

One might object: “But I still believe in Jesus, I haven’t denied the faith; I’m just struggling.” The uncomfortable truth is that **actions can deny Christ even if words claim Him.** Titus 1:16 speaks of some who *“profess to know God, but by their deeds they deny Him.”* If we persistently disobey, we are functionally denying His lordship. And Jesus said He will deny those who deny Him. So the person engrossed in habitual, unrepentant sin is, in effect, renouncing Christ’s rule, regardless of what creeds they affirm.

The **final judgment** will not be based on mere claims but on reality. Jesus said many will say to Him “Lord, Lord” and recount religious acts they did, yet He will respond, *“I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness”* (Matt. 7:23). Notice the reason: their life was one of lawlessness (i.e., unrepented sin). This shows that *practicing lawlessness* is incompatible with knowing Christ. If one continues in lawlessness (which includes sexual immorality, among other things), it won’t matter that they once “accepted Christ” or attended church. The question will be: **Did you turn from your lawlessness?** If not, the verdict is “depart from Me.”

It is a fearful thing to imagine hearing those words from the Savior whom you perhaps thought was your friend. Contemplating that moment—standing before the blazing holiness of Jesus with all secrets laid bare—can be a great motivator for change. The early saints used to meditate on the Four Last Things (death, judgment, heaven, hell) as a spiritual discipline to cultivate sobriety and wisdom. We would do well to reclaim some of that. Not morbidly or constantly, but enough to shake us out of temptation’s trance. Next time you feel lured to click that obscene link or cheat in that business deal or nurse that grudge, **pause and picture the Judgment Day.** Imagine the books opened (Rev. 20:12) which have recorded every deed and even every secret thought (Eccl. 12:14). What will that sin look like in the light of God’s throne? Picture also the faces of the saints, shining like the sun (Matt. 13:43), and ask: do I want to throw away a share in *that* glory for this fleeting sin now? Picture, too, the horror on the faces of those being sent away into outer darkness, realizing too late that no excuse stands in that court. These thoughts are not pleasant, but they are salutary medicine for a sin-sick soul.

The point here is not to keep true believers in constant fear that they might accidentally slip into hell. The point is to instill a <b>healthy, saving fear that awakens the lukewarm and hypocritical</b>. If a person is in willful sin, they <i>should</i> be afraid. That fear can lead them to wisdom (Prov. 9:10). <b>If they heed the warning, they will not face the reality</b>. God’s threats, like His promises, are meant to achieve moral ends. When He says “the immoral will not inherit the kingdom” (1 Cor. 6:9–10), it serves the purpose of jolting the immoral person to repentance so that, ironically, they <i>can</i> inherit the kingdom after all (because they became washed and sanctified)[<i><sup>biblegateway.com</sup></i>](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/1%20Corinthians%206%3A11#:~:text=match%20at%20L364%20And%20such,the%20Spirit%20of%20our%20God). If we dilute the threat, we rob it of this effect.

Therefore, as an act of love, let me state plainly: *Dear friend, if you are practicing pornography, adultery, habitual deceit, hatred, or any such willful sin, you are on the road to damnation. Please do not console yourself with thoughts of past religious moments or God’s love in general.* The Scripture says, *“Because of these things [sins] the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience”* (Eph. 5:6). Do not be a son of disobedience. Right now, perhaps, God’s wrath *abides on you* (John 3:36) even as you read this, if you have refused to repent. That wrath is not yet poured out only because of God’s patience, which is meant to lead you to repentance (Rom. 2:4). Do not “think lightly” of that kindness by continuing in sin, because you will store up wrath for yourself (Rom. 2:5). Rather, let the **fear of the Lord** now prompt you to run to the **mercy of the Lord**.

Here is the paradox of the gospel: the ones who *refuse* to fear will eventually face the thing feared; the ones who *do* fear (and thus repent) will find that in Christ their fears are relieved. As the psalmist says, *“His mercy is on those who fear Him”* (Luke 1:50). The God who warns us is also the God who welcomes us when we heed the warning. So let’s transition now from the warning to the welcome: what does thorough repentance look like, and how can we be sure of God’s help and acceptance in it?
## <a name="_toc197890402"></a>True Repentance: Immediate, Complete, Reliant on God
**What does God require of the sinner?** In a word, repent! But repentance in the biblical sense is a rich concept involving the whole person—mind, heart, and will. It is not a process that earns forgiveness (forgiveness is a free gift through Christ’s atonement), but it is the *necessary response* to truly receive that forgiveness. We have emphasized it must be *thorough*. Now let’s break down some qualities of true repentance:

**1. Immediate – Do not delay.** The moment you become aware of sin, the time to repent is *now*. *“Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts”* (Heb. 3:15). The longer one stays in sin, the harder the heart can become, and tomorrow is promised to no one. Immediate repentance means you don’t toy with half-measures or say, “I’ll taper off my sin gradually.” For example, if convicted about pornography, one shouldn’t decide, “I’ll stop after a few more indulgences” or “I’ll quit next month when it’s more convenient.” **Delayed obedience is disobedience.** The prodigal son didn’t finish out his harlots and then return; once he “came to himself,” he got up at once and went to his father. There is urgency in Scripture’s calls: *“Seek the Lord while He may be found; call upon Him while He is near. Let the wicked forsake his way… let him return to the Lord”* (Isa. 55:6–7). The implication is, there comes a time when God may *not* be found—i.e., opportunity lost, or heart too dull to respond. So do it now, this very day. Burn the bridges to your sin immediately. There is a story of early church converts who, upon baptism, would sometimes publicly burn their occult scrolls or idols (as in Acts 19:18–19). Likewise, a modern believer might delete his stash of illicit files, flush drugs, break ungodly ties, **the very hour** they repent—so there is no turning back. That kind of prompt action both proves and reinforces the sincerity of repentance.

**2. Complete – Holding nothing back.** Partial repentance will not do. This doesn’t mean you instantly become aware of every sin in your life; God often reveals layer by layer. But it means with respect to what you *do* know, you conceal nothing and yield everything. You don’t say, “Lord, I’ll give up porn but still harbor bitterness,” or “I’ll stop cheating on my taxes but not going to give up my porn.” We cannot negotiate with God, turning over one sin while keeping another. The heart of repentance is **full surrender**: “Lord, I put my whole self on your altar—do with me as You will. Correct everything in me that grieves You.” Often one big sin is the focus, but true repentance of that will bleed into other areas. It’s like pulling a nasty weed—if you really pull the root, other entangled roots come out too. If you just break off the top, the root stays. Therefore, aim at the root: a heart that says yes to sin must become a heart that says yes to God. Specific actions will follow accordingly.

Complete repentance also means you don’t deliberately leave any open doors. For instance, someone might say they repent of an emotional affair with a coworker, yet they “need” to continue working closely with that person and just try to manage their feelings. If the situation is causing you to sin, radical action (like changing jobs) may be needed. Cutting off sin at the source can be painful, but it’s part of that “plucking out the eye” Jesus spoke of.

**3. Humble – Confession and brokenness.** Repentance involves **confessing** our sins to God and, when appropriate, to others. *“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us”* (1 John 1:9). Confession means to “agree with” – we agree with God’s verdict on our sin (no minimizing, no blaming others). It’s important in prayer to name the sin specifically: not just “I messed up,” but “Lord, I have committed adultery in my heart by viewing pornography. I have been unfaithful to You and (if married) to my spouse. I have indulged lust; I have exposed my mind to filth; I have contributed to an industry that exploits and defiles others. Forgive me.” Specific confession cultivates true contrition. David’s Psalm 51 is a model—he says *“Against You, You only, have I sinned and done what is evil in Your sight”* and *“Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God”* (for his murder of Uriah). He owns even the worst of his crimes. And he is **broken-hearted**: *“The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise.”* (Ps. 51:17). We too must come with that broken spirit. Not that we have to manufacture emotion, but we should pray for godly sorrow if we lack it: “Lord, break my heart over my sin—let me see it as You do.” When God grants tears of repentance, they are precious.

Confession to others is also vital in many cases. James 5:16 says *“Confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another so that you may be healed.”* This doesn’t mean broadcasting to everyone, but it means we shouldn’t keep our sin in solitary darkness. Bringing it into the light with a trusted brother or sister or pastor is often the moment when its power breaks. It’s humbling (pride hates to admit fault), but that humility is exactly what we need. God gives grace to the humble (James 4:6). If you’ve been struggling alone, *resolve not to remain alone*. Find a mature Christian friend or leader, and confess your struggle and desire to repent. Not only will this keep you accountable, it’s also biblical: the early church practiced public or semi-public confession for serious sins, and they found it medicinal for the soul. It guards against self-deception and half-hearted measures because now someone else knows and can ask you how you’re doing. It also invites the church community into your healing process, even if it’s just one or two others at first.

Also, if your sin directly harmed others (e.g., marital unfaithfulness, lying to someone, stealing), **complete repentance includes seeking their forgiveness and making restitution where possible.** Zacchaeus, upon repenting, immediately declared he’d pay back fourfold anyone he defrauded (Luke 19:8). That was fruit of repentance. If you’ve lied to your spouse about your porn use, repentance likely means sitting down and confessing the truth, painful as that may be, and seeking their forgiveness and help to change. This can be extremely hard, but it’s often the turning point from darkness to light in the marriage. The breach of trust needs addressing so that true healing can happen. Likewise, if one’s sin has been public scandal, a public apology may be in order. These acts of contrition do not earn forgiveness from God (Christ’s blood alone does that), but they are the fitting **fruits** of repentance (Luke 3:8) and they help to straighten what was twisted by our sin.

**4. Reliant on God’s power – saturated in prayer and Word.** As we’ve stressed, repentance is not merely a human endeavor. **It is a collaboration with grace.** One of the most important things a repentant person can do is **pray** continually for deliverance and strength. Jesus urged His disciples, *“Watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation”* (Matt. 26:41). In practical terms, that means keeping a very active prayer life, especially surrounding your areas of weakness. Do not trust yourself. If you must be on a business trip with an empty hotel room (a common temptation scenario for some), don’t just white-knuckle it—pray before, during, and after. Ask others to pray for you too.

Fill your mind with Scripture. The Psalmist said, *“Your word I have treasured in my heart, that I may not sin against You”* (Ps. 119:11). There are specific scriptures that directly counter lust, greed, anger, etc. Find them, memorize them, meditate on them daily. When Jesus was tempted by Satan, He responded with Scripture each time: *“It is written…”* This shows us the sword of the Spirit must be unsheathed in battle. For example, if lust is the issue, memorize verses like *“Flee youthful lusts”* (2 Tim. 2:22) or *“I have made a covenant with my eyes; how then could I gaze at a virgin?”* (Job 31:1) or *“Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God”* (Matt. 5:8). Quote them when temptation arises. There is supernatural power in the Word to renew our mind. Over time, where lustful images once dominated, now God’s Word will. But it takes repetition and intentionality—literally reprogramming our thinking by truth (Rom. 12:2).

<b>5. Immediate in effect – experiencing God’s forgiveness instantly.</b> It’s important to know that the moment repentance (coupled with faith) is genuine, God’s forgiveness is granted. We may still <i>feel</i> guilty or unworthy for a time, but positionally, if you have turned back to God, He <i>has</i> already embraced you. Think of the prodigal son: as soon as he started his confession, the father was already hugging him and ordering the robe and ring (Luke 15:20–22). God does not humiliate us or put us on probation: <i>“There is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus”</i> (Rom. 8:1). So while the process of breaking sin’s habits takes time, the reception of mercy is immediate upon repentance. This is vital, because sometimes people languish in unnecessary guilt even after confessing. The enemy may whisper, “God doesn’t want you back, not after what you did. You need to wallow longer.” No, friend. Jesus’s blood is sufficient. The promise is: <i>“If we confess… He will forgive and cleanse”[<sup>bible.lockman.org](https://bible.lockman.org/htm_php-c.php?do=show_node&b=67&c=0&v=0&show_ti=2966&show_ts=1&show_user_id=ca7a55acd81d7f5cdd0c6cff2c0bc96e&show_question_id=17377#:~:text=,Security%3A%20Can%20You%20Be%20Sure)[bible.lockman.org</i></sup>](https://bible.lockman.org/htm_php-c.php?do=show_node&b=67&c=0&v=0&show_ti=2966&show_ts=1&show_user_id=ca7a55acd81d7f5cdd0c6cff2c0bc96e&show_question_id=17377#:~:text=,Security%2C%20Can%20You%20Be%20Sure)</i>. We must trust that promise, not our emotions. Part of repentance is believing God’s word about forgiveness. Some ironically need to repent of unbelief in God’s mercy, holding their sin as if it’s too special to be forgiven. True humility accepts forgiveness gratefully.

**6. Ongoing and enduring – a new lifestyle.** Finally, true repentance is not a one-time act but the **beginning of a new walk**. The Greek word for repentance *metanoia* literally means “change of mind,” and the Hebrew concept *teshuva* means “returning” (to God). Both convey a permanent change of direction. Imagine walking westward (toward sin) and then turning to walk eastward (toward God). That’s repentance. But if a person “repents” for a week and then goes right back, that wasn’t genuine—the direction didn’t truly change, it was a brief detour.

Jesus said, *“No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God”* (Luke 9:62). The call to repentance is a call to **persevere** in a new direction to the end. Matthew 24:13: *“the one who endures to the end, he will be saved.”* This does not mean our endurance merits salvation, but it evidences it. So, part of our counsel is: *Make up your mind that by God’s grace, you will never go back.* Burn the ships, like Cortés arriving in the New World, so there’s no retreat. If you do fall, you get up and resume forward, you do not capitulate and say “I guess I can’t do this.” The proverb says *“Though a righteous man falls seven times, he rises again.”* (Prov. 24:16). We have to adopt that tenacity. Some days will be harder than others. Some temptations will surge when you least expect. Endure. *“You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood in your striving against sin,”* Hebrews 12:4 reminds us—implying, keep striving, it’s worth the fight.

God’s promise to those who repent and *continue* in His ways is sure: they will find life. Jesus told the church in Smyrna, *“Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life”* (Rev. 2:10). And to the one in Thyatira who was compromising, He said if they overcome, they will rule with Him (Rev. 2:26–27). In every case, **repentance restored to favor and reward, but it had to be maintained.**

This is where **reliance on God** remains critical. If I consider enduring in my own strength, I despair. But if I trust that *“He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus”* (Phil. 1:6), then I have confidence that as I abide in Christ daily, He will see me through. Jude’s doxology encourages us that God *“is able to keep you from stumbling”* (Jude 24). We must lean on that ability, not ours.

So, repent immediately and completely, continue steadfastly, and lean wholly on the Lord all along. That is the blueprint. Now, what does this look like in community, and how can we practically encourage and sustain a repentant life? We turn to the example of the early church and some practical tools like liturgies and reflective practices.
## <a name="_toc197890403"></a>Renunciation and Restoration: Following the Early Church Model
The early church not only preached repentance, they **practiced it communally**. New converts in the early centuries often underwent catechesis where they would explicitly **renounce the devil and all his works** before baptism. Tertullian (3rd century) describes how candidates said, “I renounce you, Satan, and your pomps and your angels.” This formal renunciation was a way of solidifying the break with the old life. It might be beneficial for modern believers to similarly articulate their renunciations. For instance, a man repenting of pornography might pray or declare in writing: “I renounce the spirit of lust and the idol of sexual pleasure. I renounce every lie that has kept me bound (like ‘I deserve this’ or ‘I can’t help it’). I renounce Satan’s claim on my mind through these images. I belong to Jesus Christ—mind, body, and soul.” Such declarations have no magic, but they help the believer mentally and spiritually draw a line in the sand. They can be spoken aloud in private prayer or with a pastor present for accountability. The point is to engage the will and mouth in **choosing allegiance to Christ over sin.**

Early Christians also had a process for restoring those who fell into major sins after baptism. In many cases, they imposed a period of penance—acts of contrition, exclusion from communion for a time, and then a formal reconciliation service. While some aspects of that became overly rigid in later church history, the underlying principle is sound: serious sin requires serious repentance, and **the church community should be involved in restoring the sinner gently** (Gal. 6:1). In Protestant circles we may not have a sacrament of penance, but we should still have a pathway for restoration that follows church discipline and might include counseling, increased accountability, steps to rebuild trust, etc. 

Another early practice was **corporate confession in worship.** Even today, many liturgical churches include a prayer of confession and assurance of pardon each Sunday. Evangelical churches could benefit from that. It normalizes repentance as part of ongoing Christian life. It reminds everyone that though saved by grace, we still need to examine ourselves and confess frequently. A sample might be: *“Most merciful God, we confess that we have sinned against You in thought, word, and deed… We are truly sorry and we humbly repent. For the sake of Your Son Jesus Christ, have mercy on us and forgive us; that we may delight in Your will, and walk in Your ways, to the glory of Your Name. Amen.”* Many might find such prayers foreign or rote, but if done sincerely, they can be powerful. They also unite the congregation in humility. Specifically for someone struggling, hearing the whole church confess sin can break the feeling of isolation or shame—they realize, *we all are in need of grace continually.*

The early church also strongly emphasized **prayer and sometimes fasting** when dealing with stubborn sins or spiritual oppression. Jesus said some demonic kind (which could be behind addictive sins) only come out by prayer and fasting (Mark 9:29). Thus, incorporating fasting into one’s repentance journey can be beneficial. Fasting humbles the soul, intensifies prayer, and can break fleshly dominance. A repentant person might fast one day a week as they seek breakthrough, or do a multi-day fast with pastoral guidance. Again, not as a work to earn forgiveness, but as a means to discipline the body and seek God’s power (1 Cor. 9:27). The early church fasted regularly (often Wednesdays and Fridays) as part of piety. Modern believers have largely lost this, but it's being rediscovered as a potent practice.

Lastly, early Christians had a keen sense of living in the **Holy Spirit’s power**. After repentance, often there was prayer for filling of the Spirit or even deliverance ministry if needed. It would be prudent in the church today to lay hands on those coming out of enslaving sin and pray for the Holy Spirit to fill them afresh. We need divine power to truly change. In the book of Acts, believers prayed and were filled with boldness and grace to overcome challenges (Acts 4:31). So in our churches, when someone confesses and repents, let’s surround them and ask God to fill them mightily with His Spirit, to seal their decision and empower holy living.

In sum, the early church gives us a pattern of **serious community support and structure for repentance**. We should not view repentance as a merely private affair; it’s a team project in the Body of Christ. When one member suffers (in sin), the others rally to help restore them (1 Cor. 12:26). If you, reader, are repenting, do not hesitate to lean on your brothers and sisters. Let them be God’s hands and voice to you. Yes, it’s ultimately between you and God, but God often works through His people. As James says, *“pray for one another that you may be healed”* (James 5:16) – there is healing in that mutual prayer.

Now, to provide tangible guidance, the next section offers a suggested liturgy or pattern of repentance that can be used either individually or in a small group/church setting. Following that, we include reflection questions to help you dig deeper into your own heart and situation, fostering lasting change.
## <a name="_toc197890404"></a>A Liturgy of Repentance and Restoration
*(The following is a structured time of prayer, Scripture, and commitment that an individual or church group could use when seeking repentance. It is modeled after historic Christian practices but adapted to a contemporary context. This liturgy can be done privately, or a pastor could lead a congregation or small group through it. For an individual, you might read it aloud in a quiet room, perhaps even kneeling as a sign of humility.)*

**Opening Scripture:** (Read aloud Joel 2:12–13) *“‘Yet even now,’ declares the **LORD**, ‘Return to Me with all your heart, and with fasting, weeping and mourning; and rend your heart and not your garments.’ Now return to the **LORD** your God, for He is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, abounding in lovingkindness, and relenting of evil.”*

**Invitation:** Leader (or individual prays): “Dear friends (or O my soul), God calls us to return to Him with all our hearts. Let us take courage that His mercy is abundant. Now is the time to thoroughly repent and cast ourselves on His grace. Let us pray.”

**Prayer of Confession (unison or solo):** *“Most merciful God, I confess that I have sinned against You in many ways. I have (confess specific sins silently or aloud…). I have done what is evil in Your sight and failed to do what is righteous. I am heartily sorry and I humble myself before You. Have mercy on me according to Your unfailing love. Wash me clean in the blood of Jesus. I renounce my sin and all allegiance with the devil. I ask You, Holy Spirit, to help me amend my life. I yield to You completely. Empower me to walk in obedience. Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me. Restore to me the joy of Your salvation and sustain me with a willing spirit. I ask this in Jesus’ Name. Amen.”*

(**Personal silent confession** – Take a few moments to privately confess particular sins and failures. Be specific. Envision laying each at the foot of Christ’s cross. After a time of silence, continue.)

**Declaration of Pardon (Leader or self-declaration from Scripture):** *Hear the promise of God to all who truly repent and believe: “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9) And, “There is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.” (Rom. 8:1). In the name of Jesus Christ, by His authority, I declare that those who have sincerely repented and trusted in Christ are forgiven and cleansed. Thanks be to God for His mercy.*

(**Optional Action –** At this point, some tangible symbol can be done. One might write down the sins on paper and then tear it up or burn it (safely) as a sign that God wipes them out. Or one might stand from kneeling as a sign of being raised up forgiven.)

**Renewal of Commitment:** *“Holy God, by Your grace I have died to sin and now live to You. Today I reaffirm that Jesus Christ is Lord of my life. I offer myself – body, soul, and spirit – to be a living sacrifice for You. By the power of Your Holy Spirit, keep me faithful. Strengthen me to resist temptation. Help me put on the full armor of God. I commit to seek You daily in prayer and Scripture. I commit to fellowship and accountability with my brothers/sisters. I commit to flee from whatever provokes my sin and to pursue what promotes righteousness. I cannot do this on my own, but I trust You will complete the good work You have begun in me. I thank You for Your patience and for welcoming me home. In Jesus’ Name I pray. Amen.”*

**Scripture of Hope:** (One or more of the following may be read to reinforce God’s promises.) For example, *1 Corinthians 6:11* – *“Such were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.”*; or *Isaiah 1:18* – *“Though your sins are as scarlet, they will be as white as snow.”*; or *Jude 24–25* – *“Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to make you stand in the presence of His glory blameless with great joy…”*

**Prayers of Petition:** Now, spend time asking God for specific help. e.g., “Lord, fill me with the Holy Spirit. Grant me the gift of purity. Guard my eyes and thoughts. Give me a hunger for Your Word. Surround me with godly friends. Heal anyone I’ve hurt through my sins. Use my life as a testimony of Your restoring grace. Etc.” If in a group, individuals can pray out petitions and others say “Amen.”

**Closing Thanksgiving:** *“Father, thank You for hearing our cries and for your unfailing love. Thank You for the forgiveness and new beginning we have in Jesus. As we leave this time of prayer, let us go forth not in our strength but in Yours. Your grace is sufficient; Your power is made perfect in weakness. We rejoice that our sins are forgiven and that You remember them no more. By the Holy Spirit, empower us to bear fruits worthy of repentance and to shine Your light in a dark world. In Jesus’ mighty Name we pray. Amen.”*

**(Optional)** Singing a hymn like “Amazing Grace” or “Lord, I Need You” can cap the time with worship, sealing our devotion to God.

This liturgy can be adapted, shortened or extended as needed. The core idea is to walk through confession, receiving forgiveness, and re-dedicating one’s life to God, all done in an atmosphere of worship and reliance on the Holy Spirit. When used in a congregational setting, it powerfully communicates that the church takes sin seriously but also rejoices in God’s grace, fostering a culture where repentance is normal and celebrated.
## <a name="_toc197890405"></a>Reflection and Self-Examination Questions
To deepen the impact of what you’ve read and to help you apply it personally, take time to meditate on and answer the following questions. You might journal your responses or discuss them with a trusted friend or mentor. Be honest before God, for He knows the truth already and loves you still.

1. <b>Regarding Warnings:</b> When you read the warnings in Scripture about certain people not inheriting the Kingdom (e.g., 1 Cor. 6:9–10, Gal. 5:19–21), what is your immediate reaction? Do you tend to gloss over them, assume they don’t apply to you, or do they instill a healthy fear? How might God be using these warnings to get your attention about specific behaviors in your life?[<i><sup>bible.com</sup></i>](https://www.bible.com/bible/100/1CO.6.9-10.NASB1995#:~:text=Or%20do%20you%20not%20know,inherit%20the%20kingdom%20of%20God)
1. <b>Heart Check on Sin:</b> Think about the sin or sins that you struggle with repeatedly. What lies have you believed that keep you returning to them? For example, “I can’t live without it,” or “Just this last time,” or “God will forgive me anyway.” Write down these lies and then write down the truths from God’s Word that refute them. (For instance, <i>“I can do all things through Him who strengthens me”</i> (Phil. 4:13) counters “I can’t change.”) Are you willing to renounce each lie and embrace God’s truth?[<i><sup>alltogether.co.nz](https://alltogether.co.nz/a-secure-salvation-and-modern-church-preaching/#:~:text=I%20wrote%20this%20reflection%20to,preaching%20in%20many%20of%20our)[alltogether.co.nz</i></sup>](https://alltogether.co.nz/a-secure-salvation-and-modern-church-preaching/#:~:text=Calvinism%20versus%20Arminianism%20is%20an,became%20increasingly%20aware%20of%2C%20and)
1. <b>Genuine Repentance Test:</b> Evaluate your past attempts at repentance. Did you fully forsake the sin, or leave some door open? Did you rely on God, or mostly on yourself? Did you continue in new obedience, or eventually drift back? Identify what was lacking—be it depth of surrender, accountability, avoidance of temptation, etc. What concrete steps will you take now to ensure your repentance is thorough and lasting? (E.g., disposing of hidden stashes, installing accountability software, setting up regular mentor meetings, etc.)[<i><sup>biblehub.com](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/romans/6.htm#:~:text=12%20Therefore%20sin%20is%20not,the%20Law%20but%20under%20grace)[bible.lockman.org</i></sup>](https://bible.lockman.org/htm_php-c.php?do=show_node&b=67&c=0&v=0&show_ti=2966&show_ts=1&show_user_id=ca7a55acd81d7f5cdd0c6cff2c0bc96e&show_question_id=17377#:~:text=,Security%2C%20Can%20You%20Be%20Sure)
1. <b>Grace Utilization:</b> In what ways are you actively depending on God’s grace daily? Do you have a routine of prayer and Bible reading that fortifies you against sin? If not, design a simple plan (when, where, how long you’ll pray/read). Consider also: are you availing yourself of the fellowship of believers (or avoiding it out of shame)? How can the community help you, and are you willing to reach out for help? Who will you ask to be an accountability partner or prayer partner in this journey?[<i><sup>biblegateway.com</sup></i>](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus%202&version=NASB#:~:text=11%C2%A0For%20the%20grace%20of%20God,AA%29eager%20for%20good%20deeds)
1. <b>The Cost of Not Repenting:</b> Spend a few moments visualizing the trajectory of your life if you do <i>not</i> repent. What might happen to your relationships, your soul, your eternity? (For example: “If I don’t stop this affair, my marriage will likely end and I’ll wound my children, and I’ll stand before God having broken my covenant.”) Sometimes seeing the potential devastation in advance can strengthen your resolve to avoid it. How does this compare to the trajectory <i>with</i> repentance (e.g., restored relationships, clear conscience, eternal life)?[<i><sup>catholic.com](https://www.catholic.com/tract/mortal-sin#:~:text=It%20was%20not%20until%20the,them%20into%20thinking%20that%20their)[afa.net</i></sup>](https://www.afa.net/the-stand/family/2020/07/porn-and-the-church/#:~:text=%2A%2057,has%20adversely%20impacted%20the%20church)
1. **Restitution and Apology:** Is there anyone to whom you need to apologize or seek forgiveness as part of your repentance? Perhaps a spouse, child, colleague, or friend hurt by your actions? Plan how and when you will do this. Also, is there any restitution needed (returning something stolen, correcting a falsehood, paying a debt)? Make arrangements to set things right, as far as it depends on you. This can be difficult, but it bears powerful witness to the change in you and helps close the door to past wrongs.
1. <b>Endurance Plan:</b> Repentance is the start; how will you <b>endure</b> in your new walk? Anticipate future hurdles: How will you respond when tempted a month from now? A year from now? Write a “battle plan” for temptation: e.g., “If I feel weak or tempted, I will immediately pray and call X for support. I will remember such-and-such Scripture. I will remove myself from the situation.” Also, identify any patterns (HALT – hungry, angry, lonely, tired – that trigger you). How will you address those underlying states in healthy ways?[<i><sup>biblehub.com</sup></i>](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/romans/6.htm#:~:text=15%20What%20then%3F%20Are%20we,because%20of%20the%20weakness%20of)
1. **Joy of Salvation:** Reflect on the joy and relief that God’s forgiveness brings. Do you truly believe you are forgiven? If struggling with guilt, read Psalm 32 and Psalm 51. How does David move from misery to joy? Can you embrace that God really does wash you whiter than snow? **Praise Him** for His mercy until your heart warms and you sense the joy of salvation returning. How can you cultivate that joy daily (perhaps through worship music, thanksgiving prayers, serving others)? The joy of the Lord will be your strength (Neh. 8:10) in staying the course.
1. **Holiness as Love:** Consider the positive side of holiness. It’s not just about avoiding hell, but about loving God wholeheartedly and being filled with His love. In what ways will turning from sin enable you to love God and neighbor more? Perhaps your mind will be freer to focus on others, your energy not drained by shame, your relationships healed to show love. List a couple of hopeful outcomes of your repentance (e.g., “I’ll be able to worship without hypocrisy,” “My marriage can grow in trust,” “I can mentor my children with integrity,” etc.). Keep these in front of you as motivators. Holiness leads to abundant life, not loss.
1. **Accountability Check-In:** If you have an accountability partner or group, when will you check in with them, and what will you report? Plan regular intervals (daily texts, weekly meetings, etc.). If you don’t have such a system, pray about who you could invite into that role. The questions in this section can even be something you discuss with them. Maintaining openness is key to not sliding back into isolation and secrecy.

Use these questions periodically (say, once a week for the first few months, then monthly) to gauge where you are in the journey. Journaling the answers over time will let you see progress and also flag areas where you might be slipping.

**Final Encouragement:** Remember that the Christian life is one of **daily repentance and faith**. Martin Luther wrote in the first of his 95 Theses that “our Lord and Master Jesus Christ willed the entire life of believers to be one of repentance.” This simply means we live with a tender heart, quick to turn back to God whenever we stumble. It’s not meant as a life of constant morbid sorrow, but rather constant willingness to course-correct and grow. As you practice repentance, it will become a source of refreshment. *“Times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord”* (Acts 3:19) when we repent. You will find that each victory over sin, by His grace, brings greater peace and freedom. Your conscience, once burdened, will lighten. You’ll taste the sweetness of walking in the Spirit, ungrieving and unquenched.

And should you fall, do not throw in the towel. Run back to these steps. <b>Repent quickly</b>; do not stay in the mud. The Prodigal Son could have wallowed longer with the pigs, but he arose at once. <i>“A broken and contrite heart O God, You will not despise.”[<sup>thegospelcoalition.org</sup></i>](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/themelios/article/the-skim-milk-gospel-of-cheap-grace/#:~:text=,%28Part%20I%2C%20Chapter%201)</i> That promise stands. God never despises the truly contrite. He is like the father scanning the road for his returning child.

Ultimately, know that your salvation is found in <b>Jesus Christ alone</b>. Keep your eyes on Him—your Savior, Advocate, Good Shepherd, and coming King. He is able to keep you from stumbling and present you blameless[<i><sup>biblegateway.com</sup></i>](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/1%20Corinthians%206%3A11#:~:text=match%20at%20L364%20And%20such,the%20Spirit%20of%20our%20God). The call to holiness is high, but His grace is higher still. The call to repentance is urgent, but His help is near. And the joy set before us is indescribable: to hear on that Day, <i>“Well done, good and faithful servant… Enter into the joy of your Master.”</i> That joy begins even now as we walk in the light with Him.

Take heart, beloved. **Those who sow in tears will reap with songs of joy** (Ps. 126:5). The tears of repentance will water the soil of your heart, and in time, the fruits of righteousness will spring up—fruits that will last into eternity.

*“Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you entirely; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is He who calls you, and He also will bring it to pass.” (1 Thessalonians 5:23–24)[<sup>bfm.sbc.net](https://bfm.sbc.net/bfm2000/#:~:text=All%20true%20believers%20endure%20to,God%20through%20faith%20unto%20salvation)[catholic.com</sup>](https://www.catholic.com/tract/mortal-sin#:~:text=Justin%20Martyr) Amen.*

# Chapter 7: Doxology
<b>To the Holy and Triune God be all glory and honor forever.</b> We lift our hearts in awe and reverence to praise <b>the Father, Jesus Christ the Son (the Word), and the Holy Spirit</b> – one God in three Persons, blessed Trinity. <i>“Holy, Holy, Holy, is the LORD of hosts, the whole earth is full of His glory”[<sup>biblehub.com</sup></i>](https://biblehub.com/nasb/isaiah/6-3.htm#:~:text=NASB%201995%20And%20one%20called,is%20full%20of%20His%20glory)</i>. <b>Father, You are holy</b> beyond comprehension – <i>“Your eyes are too pure to approve evil, and You cannot look on wickedness with favor”</i> (Habakkuk 1:13, NASB). In Your presence the seraphim cover their faces and cry without ceasing, <i>“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come”[<sup>biblehub.com</sup></i>](https://biblehub.com/nasb/revelation/4-8.htm#:~:text=And%20the%20four%20living%20creatures%2C,AND%20WHO%20IS%20TO%20COME)</i>. <b>There is no other God like You:</b> perfect in righteousness, infinite in majesty. <i>“Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne; lovingkindness and truth go before You”[<sup>nasb.literalword.com</sup></i>](https://nasb.literalword.com/?h=17&q=Psalm+89#:~:text=14%20Righteousness%20and%20justice%20are,the%20foundation%20of%20Your%20throne)</i>. O Lord God, how <b>just</b> are all Your ways! You are <i>“the Judge of all the earth”</i> (Genesis 18:25) and You do only what is right. We glorify Your justice and holiness – a holiness that burns against sin with pure fire. <i>“Our God is a consuming fire”[<sup>biblehub.com</sup></i>](https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-29.htm#:~:text=New%20American%20Standard%20Bible%20for,God%20is%20a%20consuming%20fire)</i>; <i>You are light, and in You there is no darkness at all</i> (1 John 1:5). <b>We worship You, O God, in the splendor of holiness.</b> You are utterly set apart, morally perfect, and incapable of falsehood. <i>“God is not a man, that He should lie, nor a son of man, that He should repent”</i> (Numbers 23:19, NASB). We tremble before Your perfection. <i>Who will not fear You, O Lord?</i> <i>“Who will not fear You, O Lord, and glorify Your name? For You alone are holy”[<sup>biblehub.com</sup></i>](https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-4.htm#:~:text=New%20American%20Standard%20Bible%20%E2%80%9CWho,%E2%80%9D)</i>. We join the song of Moses and the Lamb, proclaiming the greatness of Your holiness and justice. <i>“Great and marvelous are Your works, O Lord God, the Almighty; righteous and true are Your ways, King of the nations!”</i> (Revelation 15:3–4, NASB). <b>Yours is a holiness that cannot tolerate evil</b>, yet in Your love You have made a way for sinners to be cleansed – so we praise not only Your purity, but also <b>Your mercy</b> with holy gratitude.

<b>Father of mercies, we exalt You for Your great love and compassion.</b> <i>“The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness”[<sup>biblehub.com</sup></i>](https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-8.htm#:~:text=New%20American%20Standard%20Bible%20The,anger%20and%20abounding%20in%20mercy)</i>. Oh, how patient and kind You have been toward us! When we were rebels and enemies, dead in our trespasses, <b>You showed mercy.</b> <i>“You, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive, and abundant in lovingkindness to all who call upon You”</i> (Psalm 86:5, NASB). We marvel at <b>Your mercy and grace</b> displayed in sending Your Son for our salvation: <i>“For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life”</i> (John 3:16, NASB). In Christ, <b>Your mercy triumphed over judgment</b> – yet never at the expense of Your justice. We praise You that at the cross <i>“lovingkindness and truth have met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other”</i> (Psalm 85:10, NASB). <b>You are just and the justifier</b> of the one who has faith in Jesus (Romans 3:26). Your mercy does not negate Your holiness; instead, in the gospel <b>Your holiness and mercy shine together</b>. We therefore approach You with reverent love, amazed that we can call the Holy One <i>“Father!”</i> <i>“See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we would be called children of God”</i> (1 John 3:1, NASB). Abba, Father, we adore You. We know that <b>Your kindness is meant to lead us to repentance</b>, not to presumption. We glorify You for Your <b>patience</b>, for You have borne with us through our failures and stubbornness. <i>“The Lord is not slow about His promise… but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance”[<sup>nasb.literalword.com</sup></i>](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=2+Peter+3%3A9#:~:text=9%20The%20Lord%20is%20not,all%20to%20come%20to%20repentance)</i>. O God, we shudder to think how many times we would have perished were it not for <b>Your long-suffering love</b> holding back wrath and giving us opportunity to repent. <i>Great is Your faithfulness!</i> <i>“It is of the LORD’s mercies that we are not consumed, because His compassions fail not. They are new every morning”</i> (Lamentations 3:22–23, NASB). We extol Your name, for You <b>delight in mercy</b> (Micah 7:18) and <b>take no pleasure in the death of the wicked</b>, but rather that he turn from his way and live (Ezekiel 33:11). <b>All praise to You for Your amazing grace</b>, by which we who deserved wrath have received salvation and hope.

Yet even as we praise Your mercy, we also acknowledge and revere <b>Your wrath and righteous anger against sin</b>. You are a God of perfect <b>justice</b> and truth. <i>“You will by no means leave the guilty unpunished”</i> (Nahum 1:3, NASB). <b>We glorify You for Your justice</b> that refuses to shrug off evil. O Lord, <b>Your wrath is pure and holy</b>, not like human anger. You are <i>“slow to anger”</i> (Psalm 103:8), but when Your anger comes it is utterly righteous. <i>“The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men”</i> (Romans 1:18, NASB), and one day it will be fully unveiled at the judgment. We tremble at this truth and give You glory. <i>“Who understands the power of Your anger and Your fury, according to the fear that is due You?”</i> (Psalm 90:11, NASB). Your apostles taught us both <i>“the kindness and severity of God”</i> (Romans 11:22, NASB) – may we never presume on one and dismiss the other. <b>You are to be loved and feared.</b> <i>“Serve the LORD with fear and rejoice with trembling”</i> (Psalm 2:11, NASB). We fear You, O God, not with slavish terror, but with reverent awe, for we know <b>Your judgments are true and good</b>. <i>“The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever; the judgments of the Lord are true; they are righteous altogether”</i> (Psalm 19:9, NASB). We bow before Your <b>awesome judgment seat</b>. You have declared a day on which <i>“You will judge the world in righteousness through a Man whom You have appointed”[<sup>nasb.literalword.com</sup></i>](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=Acts+17%3A31-32#:~:text=31%20because%20He%20has%20fixed,%E2%80%9D)</i> – namely, Jesus Christ, <i>“the righteous Judge”</i> (2 Timothy 4:8). We acknowledge that <b>Your judgment is part of Your glory</b>. As much as we rejoice in Your mercy, we also solemnly rejoice that <i>evil will not triumph</i> and <i>every wrong will be righted</i> by Your just hand. <i>“Clouds and thick darkness surround Him; righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne”</i> (Psalm 97:2, NASB). O holy God, even Your wrath and judgment cause us to sing praise, for in them we see <b>Your holiness vindicated</b> and the moral order of Your creation restored. <i>“Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God, because His judgments are true and righteous”</i> (Revelation 19:1–2, NASB). <b>Not unto us, O Lord, but to Your name give glory</b> for being both just and the justifier, both merciful and wrathful against sin.

We cannot worship You rightly, O God, without exalting <b>Jesus Christ, Your Son, the Living Word.</b> Lord Jesus, we magnify Your name above every name, for You are <b>the Word who was with God and was God</b> from the beginning (John 1:1). <i>“Through [You] all things were made”</i> (John 1:3) – You spoke and worlds came into being. Yet in the fullness of time, You <i>“became flesh and dwelt among us”</i> (John 1:14). <b>Worthy are You, O Christ, our Savior!</b> You are the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. We extol Your humility and sacrifice: though You existed in the form of God, You did not cling to divine privilege, but emptied Yourself, took on the form of a servant, and became obedient to the point of death on a cross (Philippians 2:6–8). <b>All praise to the Lamb who was slain!</b> By Your blood You ransomed people for God from every tribe and tongue[<i><sup>biblehub.com</sup></i>](https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-4.htm#:~:text=New%20American%20Standard%20Bible%20%E2%80%9CWho,%E2%80%9D). <i>“Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing”</i> (Revelation 5:12, NASB). Lord Jesus, we glorify You as <b>the embodiment of God’s mercy</b> – <i>in You we have redemption through Your blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of [God’s] grace</i> (Ephesians 1:7). We also glorify You as <b>the embodiment of God’s holiness and truth</b> – <i>“in [You] are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge”</i> (Colossians 2:3), and <i>“in [You] all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form”</i> (Colossians 2:9). You are <i>“the radiance of [the Father’s] glory and the exact representation of His nature”</i> (Hebrews 1:3, NASB). We bow before Your absolute <b>lordship</b>: <i>“King of kings and Lord of lords”</i> are You, and at Your name <i>“every knee will bow... and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father”</i> (Philippians 2:10–11, NASB).

We not only adore You for Your first coming and the cross, dear Lord, but also for <b>Your resurrection, ascension, and promised return in glory.</b> You are <i>“alive forevermore”</i> (Revelation 1:18) – the <b>Living One who conquered the grave.</b> <i>“Death no longer is master over You”</i> (Romans 6:9). Risen Christ, You have triumphed over every enemy; <i>“You disarmed the rulers and authorities”</i> (Colossians 2:15) and made a public spectacle of them. We proclaim <b>Your victory</b>: <i>“Worthy are You... for You were slain, and purchased for God with Your blood men from every nation”</i> (Revelation 5:9, NASB). Having accomplished redemption, You ascended to heaven and sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high (Hebrews 1:3). <b>All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to You</b> (Matthew 28:18). We eagerly await <b>Your second coming</b>, when You will appear not as a suffering servant but as the <b>Judge of all the earth</b>. <i>“Behold, He is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him”</i> (Revelation 1:7, NASB). Maranatha – come, Lord Jesus! We know that when You come, You will <b>judge the living and the dead</b> in perfect righteousness. <i>“He has fixed a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness through a Man whom He has appointed, having furnished proof to all by raising Him from the dead”[<sup>nasb.literalword.com</sup></i>](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=Acts+17%3A31-32#:~:text=31%20because%20He%20has%20fixed,%E2%80%9D)</i> – and You, O Christ, are that appointed Judge. We honor You for this, even as we soberedly acknowledge that <b>Your judgment is fierce</b>. Scripture paints the scene of Your return: <i>“From His mouth comes a sharp sword, so that with it He may strike down the nations... and He treads the wine press of the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty”</i> (Revelation 19:15, NASB). <i>“On His robe and on His thigh He has a name written: ‘KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS’”</i> (Revelation 19:16, NASB). O Jesus, <b>we praise You as the sovereign King</b> who will subdue all evil. <i>“The Lord will judge His people”[<sup>nasb.literalword.com</sup></i>](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=Hebrews+10%3A26-39#:~:text=who%20has%20trampled%20under%20foot,hands%20of%20the%20living%20God)</i>, and that Lord is You – for <i>“the Father has given all judgment to the Son”</i> (John 5:22, NASB). We find refuge in Your mercy now, knowing that on that Day <b>only those washed in Your blood</b> will stand. <i>“Who can endure the day of His coming, and who can stand when He appears?”</i> (Malachi 3:2, NASB). Only by <b>hiding in You</b> can we hope to endure, for You are our righteousness (1 Corinthians 1:30). So even as we fear Your coming wrath, we cry out in worship: <i>“Amen. Come, Lord Jesus”</i> (Revelation 22:20, NASB). <b>May Your Name be praised forever, Lord Jesus – Lamb of God, Lion of Judah, Redeemer, Judge, and King.</b> Every facet of Your person and work compels our praise.

We also give honor and glory to **You, O Holy Spirit – the eternal Spirit of the Living God.** You are the promised Comforter, the Spirit of truth proceeding from the Father and the Son. We worship You as **fully God**, one with the Father and Son in the Godhead – not merely an influence, but a divine Person, worthy of eternal adoration. Holy Spirit, **we praise You for Your work in creation and providence**: *“The Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the waters”* in the beginning (Genesis 1:2), and *“by His Spirit He adorned the heavens”* (Job 26:13). You gave life to all living things; *“You send forth Your Spirit, they are created”* (Psalm 104:30, NASB). We praise You for **inspiring the Holy Scriptures** – You moved prophets and apostles to speak from God (2 Peter 1:21), so that every word of Scripture is *“God-breathed”* (2 Timothy 3:16). We thank You, Spirit of God, for preserving and illuminating God’s Word to us even now. We glorify You for **exalting Christ** in our hearts – You do not speak on Your own initiative, but You take of what is Christ’s and disclose it to us (John 16:13–14). It is You who opened our blind eyes to see the beauty of Jesus. **We were dead in sin, and You made us alive.** *“That which is born of the Spirit is spirit”* (John 3:6, NASB); *“the Spirit gives life”* (2 Corinthians 3:6). All praise to You for causing us to be *“born again”* (John 3:5) – regenerating our hearts, pouring the love of God into us (Romans 5:5), and testifying that we are God’s children (Romans 8:16). O Holy Spirit, **we adore You as the Sanctifier** of the saints. You are the One who convicts the world concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment (John 16:8). In each of us who believe, it was **Your voice** that first pierced our conscience and pointed us to Christ. And having brought us to Christ, You now work to make us like Christ. *“From glory to glory”* You transform us into His image by Your power (2 Corinthians 3:18). **We thank You, Spirit of holiness, for patiently purging sin from our lives.** You dwell within us – how sacred and astounding this truth is! Our bodies are a temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19). You intercede for us with groanings too deep for words (Romans 8:26), helping us in our weakness when we don’t know how to pray. You bear fruit in us – love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control (Galatians 5:22–23) – none of which we could produce on our own. By **Your power** we put to death the deeds of the body (Romans 8:13). By **Your guidance** we walk in newness of life. *“For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God”* (Romans 8:14, NASB). We honor You, Holy Spirit, for **sealing us** for the day of redemption (Ephesians 4:30). You are the **pledge of our inheritance** (Ephesians 1:13–14), the down payment guaranteeing that God will complete what He started in us. You unite us to Christ and to one another in the one Body. You distribute gifts to each believer as You will (1 Corinthians 12:11) for the building up of the Church – and thus **we glorify You for every gift and manifestation of Your presence** among us. We reverence Your holiness: how careful we must be not to *“grieve the Holy Spirit of God”* (Ephesians 4:30, NASB) by whom we were sealed. You are *“holy”* – You cannot abide sin in Your temple. Yet when we do sin, it is You who brings us to godly sorrow and back to the cross for cleansing. Thank You, gentle Spirit, for striving with us and not abandoning us. **Divine Spirit, we worship You** for indwelling us individually and corporately. Without You, we would have no connection to Christ or the Father; with You, *“the love of God has been poured out within our hearts”* (Romans 5:5, NASB). Truly, *“where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty”* (2 Corinthians 3:17, NASB) – freedom from bondage and adoption as God’s children. We bow in awe that the infinite God makes His home in us by Your presence, O Spirit of Christ. **Be glorified in us** – fill us, use us, and bring forth worship through us to the Triune God.

O God – Father, Son, and Holy Spirit – <b>You are our salvation and our hope.</b> We have seen in this book that salvation is not a light thing or a human work, but entirely <b>the work of You, the living God</b>. From eternity past, Father, You foreknew and loved a people; in time, Lord Jesus, You lived, died, and rose to purchase those people; and in our personal lives, Holy Spirit, You applied that redemption by calling us to repentance and faith. <b>All glory for our salvation belongs to You, our God.</b> We contributed nothing but our need; <b>You gave everything, and You continue to give and to sustain us in grace.</b> We acknowledge that apart from Your empowering, we are helpless. We declared in earlier chapters the sober truth that a believer can shipwreck his faith through willful sin – but even the perseverance to <i>remain</i> in Christ comes from <b>Your gracious hand</b>, O God. Thus we end not on a note of our resolve, but of <b>Your keeping power</b>. <i>“The LORD is faithful, and He will strengthen and protect you from the evil one”</i> (2 Thessalonians 3:3, NASB). We rest not in ourselves, but in <b>Your promise</b>: <i>“He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus”</i> (Philippians 1:6, NASB). We take comfort that <b>You are able to keep us from stumbling</b>. In the words of Scripture we offer doxology: <i>“Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, and to make you stand in the presence of His glory blameless with great joy, <b>to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion and authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen</b>”[<sup>nasb.literalword.com</sup></i>](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=Jude+1%3A24-25#:~:text=24%20Now%20to%20Him%20who,Amen)</i>.

**All praise to You, Almighty God!** You are **holy, holy, holy** – and by **Your grace**, we who were unholy have been made holy in Christ. You are **just** – and by Jesus’s atonement, we are justified. You are full of **wrath** against sin – and yet full of **mercy** toward sinners in Christ, having satisfied wrath on the cross. You are **patient** – not willing that any should perish – and You are **powerful to save** to the uttermost those who draw near to You through Jesus. Your **power to judge** is matched by Your power to redeem and transform. We therefore stand in awe of You. We desire our lives and eternal destinies to resound to **Your glory alone**. Let every saved soul be a trophy of Your grace and every judgment demonstrate the righteousness of Your justice. As we conclude this work, let its every warning and exhortation drive us to exalt **You**, the Triune God.

With profound reverence and love, we declare: **Yours, O Lord, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty** (1 Chronicles 29:11). There is none like You. *“From You and through You and to You are all things. To You be the glory forever. Amen”* (Romans 11:36, NASB).
