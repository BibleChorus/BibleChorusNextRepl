The Apostle **Paul** makes it painfully clear that certain behaviors, if practiced unrepentantly, bar a person from eternal life. Writing to the **Corinthian** church – which included some who had a background of sexual sin and other vices – Paul warns bluntly:

*“Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God.”[<sup>nasb.literalword.com</sup>*](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=Revelation+21%3A8%2C+Revelation+22%3A12-16#:~:text=8%20But%20for%20the%20cowardly,%E2%80%9D)*

It is difficult to imagine a more straightforward statement. Paul knew that believers might be tempted to **rationalize** ongoing sins (perhaps thinking, “Surely God wouldn’t exclude *us*, we’re saved by grace!”). So he prefaces the vice list by saying *“Do not be deceived.”* In other words, let no one trick you with empty assurances: people who live in these patterns – sexual immorality, false worship, theft and greed, substance abuse, abusive speech, cheating others – **have no inheritance in God’s kingdom**. Paul does not caveat, *“unless they once accepted Christ, in which case they’re safe.”* No – he states a general truth applicable to *anyone*. He then reminds the Corinthians that **true conversion produces a break from such sins**: *“Such were some of you; but you were washed… sanctified… justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ”* (1 Cor 6:11). The Christians at Corinth had been **cleansed and set apart** from those old identities. How unthinkable, then, for any of them to return to those sins and yet presume to **still inherit the kingdom**! The warning stands: a **“Christian” who becomes again a fornicator, drunkard, etc., and persists without repentance, will by no means be saved**. *“Do not be deceived.”*

Paul issues nearly **identical warnings** to other churches. To the **Galatians**, he writes that *“the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit”* (Gal 5:17), and he lists the “deeds of the flesh” as *“immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these.”* Then Paul, the preacher of justification by faith, adds this emphatic conclusion:

*“Of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.” (Galatians 5:19–21)*

Here again, the **inheritance of the kingdom** is conditional: if you *“practice such things”* (live habitually in these sins), you exclude yourself. In fact, Paul says he has warned them of this repeatedly (*“as I have forewarned you”*). Grace does not grant immunity to an impenitent sinner. A professing Christian who persists in *any* of these works of the flesh – whether sexual impurity, idolatry/occult practice, or relational sins like fits of anger and divisiveness – **will forfeit the kingdom of God**. This is a sobering reality. Paul is not afraid it will undermine *sola fide*; rather, he sees it as integral to the gospel call. Those truly justified by faith *also receive the Spirit*, who leads them away from the domination of such sins. *“If we live by the Spirit,”* Paul concludes, *“let us also walk by the Spirit”* (Gal 5:25). Any “faith” that produces only the **works of the flesh** and not the **fruit of the Spirit** (Gal 5:22–23) is no saving faith at all (cf. James 2:17).

In Paul’s letter to the **Ephesians**, we find a similar list and warning. He says *“immorality or any impurity or greed”* must not even be named among saints, and adds:

*“For this you know with certainty, that no immoral or impure person or covetous man, who is an idolater, has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.” (Ephesians 5:5–6)*

Note the phrasing “*with certainty*” – Paul wants zero doubt on this point. Someone whose life is characterized by sexual immorality, impurity (a broader term for uncleanness), or greedy idolatry (essentially, unchecked covetousness/materialism which amounts to worshiping a false god) – **such a person is not going to inherit Christ’s kingdom**. Period. Again he anticipates the **“empty words”** of false teachers who might say otherwise (“God won’t really exclude you; you’re His people!”). Paul insists that those very sins **incur God’s wrath** on the disobedient. How could anyone claiming to be saved take part in what provokes God’s holy anger? *“Do not be partners with them,”* he immediately adds (Eph 5:7). The clear implication is that **if we live like “sons of disobedience,” we will share their fate under wrath**. Our identity must be proven by our deeds; those united to Christ walk in light, not darkness (Eph 5:8).

Thus, three times Paul lists <b>specific sins</b> and plainly states that practitioners of such <b>will not enter heaven</b>. These are not isolated proof-texts but a consistent apostolic teaching, conveyed to multiple churches. We could add that <b>John in Revelation</b> agrees, for he writes that in the New Jerusalem <i>“nothing unclean, and no one who practices abomination and lying, shall ever come into it”</i> (Rev 21:27). Earlier he records that <i>“the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and <b>sexually immoral persons</b> and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars”</i> will have <b>“their part... in the lake that burns with fire... the second death.”[<i><sup>nasb.literalword.com</sup></i>](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=Revelation+21%3A8%2C+Revelation+22%3A12-16#:~:text=8%20But%20for%20the%20cowardly,%E2%80%9D)</b>. The <b>end of the story</b> has the same moral as all these epistles: sin may seem to triumph for a season, but <b>every unrepentant sinner will be barred from God’s glorious kingdom</b> and instead will meet with eternal fire. The apostles and Scripture authors did not soften that reality even when addressing <i>baptized believers</i>. They loved their readers enough to warn them: do not be deceived – a name on a church roll, a past experience, or a mere profession of faith means nothing if you <b>choose a life of unrighteousness</b>. <b>Grace is amazing</b>, but <i>“God is not mocked”</i>: <i>“the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap <b>corruption</b>”</i> (Gal 6:7–8). As Paul told the <b>Romans</b>, <i>“if you are living according to the flesh, <b>you must die</b>; but if by the Spirit you are putting to death the deeds of the body, <b>you will live</b>”</i> (Rom 8:13). <b>Eternal life and death</b> hang in the balance, depending on whether we crucify our flesh or cater to it.
