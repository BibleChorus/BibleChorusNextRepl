<b>To the Holy and Triune God be all glory and honor forever.</b> We lift our hearts in awe and reverence to praise <b>the Father, Jesus Christ the Son (the Word), and the Holy Spirit</b> – one God in three Persons, blessed Trinity. <i>“Holy, Holy, Holy, is the LORD of hosts, the whole earth is full of His glory”[<sup>biblehub.com</sup></i>](https://biblehub.com/nasb/isaiah/6-3.htm#:~:text=NASB%201995%20And%20one%20called,is%20full%20of%20His%20glory)</i>. <b>Father, You are holy</b> beyond comprehension – <i>“Your eyes are too pure to approve evil, and You cannot look on wickedness with favor”</i> (Habakkuk 1:13, NASB). In Your presence the seraphim cover their faces and cry without ceasing, <i>“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come”[<sup>biblehub.com</sup></i>](https://biblehub.com/nasb/revelation/4-8.htm#:~:text=And%20the%20four%20living%20creatures%2C,AND%20WHO%20IS%20TO%20COME)</i>. <b>There is no other God like You:</b> perfect in righteousness, infinite in majesty. <i>“Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne; lovingkindness and truth go before You”[<sup>nasb.literalword.com</sup></i>](https://nasb.literalword.com/?h=17&q=Psalm+89#:~:text=14%20Righteousness%20and%20justice%20are,the%20foundation%20of%20Your%20throne)</i>. O Lord God, how <b>just</b> are all Your ways! You are <i>“the Judge of all the earth”</i> (Genesis 18:25) and You do only what is right. We glorify Your justice and holiness – a holiness that burns against sin with pure fire. <i>“Our God is a consuming fire”[<sup>biblehub.com</sup></i>](https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-29.htm#:~:text=New%20American%20Standard%20Bible%20for,God%20is%20a%20consuming%20fire)</i>; <i>You are light, and in You there is no darkness at all</i> (1 John 1:5). <b>We worship You, O God, in the splendor of holiness.</b> You are utterly set apart, morally perfect, and incapable of falsehood. <i>“God is not a man, that He should lie, nor a son of man, that He should repent”</i> (Numbers 23:19, NASB). We tremble before Your perfection. <i>Who will not fear You, O Lord?</i> <i>“Who will not fear You, O Lord, and glorify Your name? For You alone are holy”[<sup>biblehub.com</sup></i>](https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-4.htm#:~:text=New%20American%20Standard%20Bible%20%E2%80%9CWho,%E2%80%9D)</i>. We join the song of Moses and the Lamb, proclaiming the greatness of Your holiness and justice. <i>“Great and marvelous are Your works, O Lord God, the Almighty; righteous and true are Your ways, King of the nations!”</i> (Revelation 15:3–4, NASB). <b>Yours is a holiness that cannot tolerate evil</b>, yet in Your love You have made a way for sinners to be cleansed – so we praise not only Your purity, but also <b>Your mercy</b> with holy gratitude.

<b>Father of mercies, we exalt You for Your great love and compassion.</b> <i>“The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness”[<sup>biblehub.com</sup></i>](https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-8.htm#:~:text=New%20American%20Standard%20Bible%20The,anger%20and%20abounding%20in%20mercy)</i>. Oh, how patient and kind You have been toward us! When we were rebels and enemies, dead in our trespasses, <b>You showed mercy.</b> <i>“You, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive, and abundant in lovingkindness to all who call upon You”</i> (Psalm 86:5, NASB). We marvel at <b>Your mercy and grace</b> displayed in sending Your Son for our salvation: <i>“For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life”</i> (John 3:16, NASB). In Christ, <b>Your mercy triumphed over judgment</b> – yet never at the expense of Your justice. We praise You that at the cross <i>“lovingkindness and truth have met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other”</i> (Psalm 85:10, NASB). <b>You are just and the justifier</b> of the one who has faith in Jesus (Romans 3:26). Your mercy does not negate Your holiness; instead, in the gospel <b>Your holiness and mercy shine together</b>. We therefore approach You with reverent love, amazed that we can call the Holy One <i>“Father!”</i> <i>“See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we would be called children of God”</i> (1 John 3:1, NASB). Abba, Father, we adore You. We know that <b>Your kindness is meant to lead us to repentance</b>, not to presumption. We glorify You for Your <b>patience</b>, for You have borne with us through our failures and stubbornness. <i>“The Lord is not slow about His promise… but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance”[<sup>nasb.literalword.com</sup></i>](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=2+Peter+3%3A9#:~:text=9%20The%20Lord%20is%20not,all%20to%20come%20to%20repentance)</i>. O God, we shudder to think how many times we would have perished were it not for <b>Your long-suffering love</b> holding back wrath and giving us opportunity to repent. <i>Great is Your faithfulness!</i> <i>“It is of the LORD’s mercies that we are not consumed, because His compassions fail not. They are new every morning”</i> (Lamentations 3:22–23, NASB). We extol Your name, for You <b>delight in mercy</b> (Micah 7:18) and <b>take no pleasure in the death of the wicked</b>, but rather that he turn from his way and live (Ezekiel 33:11). <b>All praise to You for Your amazing grace</b>, by which we who deserved wrath have received salvation and hope.

Yet even as we praise Your mercy, we also acknowledge and revere <b>Your wrath and righteous anger against sin</b>. You are a God of perfect <b>justice</b> and truth. <i>“You will by no means leave the guilty unpunished”</i> (Nahum 1:3, NASB). <b>We glorify You for Your justice</b> that refuses to shrug off evil. O Lord, <b>Your wrath is pure and holy</b>, not like human anger. You are <i>“slow to anger”</i> (Psalm 103:8), but when Your anger comes it is utterly righteous. <i>“The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men”</i> (Romans 1:18, NASB), and one day it will be fully unveiled at the judgment. We tremble at this truth and give You glory. <i>“Who understands the power of Your anger and Your fury, according to the fear that is due You?”</i> (Psalm 90:11, NASB). Your apostles taught us both <i>“the kindness and severity of God”</i> (Romans 11:22, NASB) – may we never presume on one and dismiss the other. <b>You are to be loved and feared.</b> <i>“Serve the LORD with fear and rejoice with trembling”</i> (Psalm 2:11, NASB). We fear You, O God, not with slavish terror, but with reverent awe, for we know <b>Your judgments are true and good</b>. <i>“The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever; the judgments of the Lord are true; they are righteous altogether”</i> (Psalm 19:9, NASB). We bow before Your <b>awesome judgment seat</b>. You have declared a day on which <i>“You will judge the world in righteousness through a Man whom You have appointed”[<sup>nasb.literalword.com</sup></i>](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=Acts+17%3A31-32#:~:text=31%20because%20He%20has%20fixed,%E2%80%9D)</i> – namely, Jesus Christ, <i>“the righteous Judge”</i> (2 Timothy 4:8). We acknowledge that <b>Your judgment is part of Your glory</b>. As much as we rejoice in Your mercy, we also solemnly rejoice that <i>evil will not triumph</i> and <i>every wrong will be righted</i> by Your just hand. <i>“Clouds and thick darkness surround Him; righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne”</i> (Psalm 97:2, NASB). O holy God, even Your wrath and judgment cause us to sing praise, for in them we see <b>Your holiness vindicated</b> and the moral order of Your creation restored. <i>“Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God, because His judgments are true and righteous”</i> (Revelation 19:1–2, NASB). <b>Not unto us, O Lord, but to Your name give glory</b> for being both just and the justifier, both merciful and wrathful against sin.

We cannot worship You rightly, O God, without exalting <b>Jesus Christ, Your Son, the Living Word.</b> Lord Jesus, we magnify Your name above every name, for You are <b>the Word who was with God and was God</b> from the beginning (John 1:1). <i>“Through [You] all things were made”</i> (John 1:3) – You spoke and worlds came into being. Yet in the fullness of time, You <i>“became flesh and dwelt among us”</i> (John 1:14). <b>Worthy are You, O Christ, our Savior!</b> You are the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. We extol Your humility and sacrifice: though You existed in the form of God, You did not cling to divine privilege, but emptied Yourself, took on the form of a servant, and became obedient to the point of death on a cross (Philippians 2:6–8). <b>All praise to the Lamb who was slain!</b> By Your blood You ransomed people for God from every tribe and tongue[<i><sup>biblehub.com</sup></i>](https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-4.htm#:~:text=New%20American%20Standard%20Bible%20%E2%80%9CWho,%E2%80%9D). <i>“Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing”</i> (Revelation 5:12, NASB). Lord Jesus, we glorify You as <b>the embodiment of God’s mercy</b> – <i>in You we have redemption through Your blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of [God’s] grace</i> (Ephesians 1:7). We also glorify You as <b>the embodiment of God’s holiness and truth</b> – <i>“in [You] are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge”</i> (Colossians 2:3), and <i>“in [You] all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form”</i> (Colossians 2:9). You are <i>“the radiance of [the Father’s] glory and the exact representation of His nature”</i> (Hebrews 1:3, NASB). We bow before Your absolute <b>lordship</b>: <i>“King of kings and Lord of lords”</i> are You, and at Your name <i>“every knee will bow... and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father”</i> (Philippians 2:10–11, NASB).

We not only adore You for Your first coming and the cross, dear Lord, but also for <b>Your resurrection, ascension, and promised return in glory.</b> You are <i>“alive forevermore”</i> (Revelation 1:18) – the <b>Living One who conquered the grave.</b> <i>“Death no longer is master over You”</i> (Romans 6:9). Risen Christ, You have triumphed over every enemy; <i>“You disarmed the rulers and authorities”</i> (Colossians 2:15) and made a public spectacle of them. We proclaim <b>Your victory</b>: <i>“Worthy are You... for You were slain, and purchased for God with Your blood men from every nation”</i> (Revelation 5:9, NASB). Having accomplished redemption, You ascended to heaven and sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high (Hebrews 1:3). <b>All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to You</b> (Matthew 28:18). We eagerly await <b>Your second coming</b>, when You will appear not as a suffering servant but as the <b>Judge of all the earth</b>. <i>“Behold, He is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him”</i> (Revelation 1:7, NASB). Maranatha – come, Lord Jesus! We know that when You come, You will <b>judge the living and the dead</b> in perfect righteousness. <i>“He has fixed a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness through a Man whom He has appointed, having furnished proof to all by raising Him from the dead”[<sup>nasb.literalword.com</sup></i>](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=Acts+17%3A31-32#:~:text=31%20because%20He%20has%20fixed,%E2%80%9D)</i> – and You, O Christ, are that appointed Judge. We honor You for this, even as we soberedly acknowledge that <b>Your judgment is fierce</b>. Scripture paints the scene of Your return: <i>“From His mouth comes a sharp sword, so that with it He may strike down the nations... and He treads the wine press of the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty”</i> (Revelation 19:15, NASB). <i>“On His robe and on His thigh He has a name written: ‘KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS’”</i> (Revelation 19:16, NASB). O Jesus, <b>we praise You as the sovereign King</b> who will subdue all evil. <i>“The Lord will judge His people”[<sup>nasb.literalword.com</sup></i>](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=Hebrews+10%3A26-39#:~:text=who%20has%20trampled%20under%20foot,hands%20of%20the%20living%20God)</i>, and that Lord is You – for <i>“the Father has given all judgment to the Son”</i> (John 5:22, NASB). We find refuge in Your mercy now, knowing that on that Day <b>only those washed in Your blood</b> will stand. <i>“Who can endure the day of His coming, and who can stand when He appears?”</i> (Malachi 3:2, NASB). Only by <b>hiding in You</b> can we hope to endure, for You are our righteousness (1 Corinthians 1:30). So even as we fear Your coming wrath, we cry out in worship: <i>“Amen. Come, Lord Jesus”</i> (Revelation 22:20, NASB). <b>May Your Name be praised forever, Lord Jesus – Lamb of God, Lion of Judah, Redeemer, Judge, and King.</b> Every facet of Your person and work compels our praise.

We also give honor and glory to **You, O Holy Spirit – the eternal Spirit of the Living God.** You are the promised Comforter, the Spirit of truth proceeding from the Father and the Son. We worship You as **fully God**, one with the Father and Son in the Godhead – not merely an influence, but a divine Person, worthy of eternal adoration. Holy Spirit, **we praise You for Your work in creation and providence**: *“The Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the waters”* in the beginning (Genesis 1:2), and *“by His Spirit He adorned the heavens”* (Job 26:13). You gave life to all living things; *“You send forth Your Spirit, they are created”* (Psalm 104:30, NASB). We praise You for **inspiring the Holy Scriptures** – You moved prophets and apostles to speak from God (2 Peter 1:21), so that every word of Scripture is *“God-breathed”* (2 Timothy 3:16). We thank You, Spirit of God, for preserving and illuminating God’s Word to us even now. We glorify You for **exalting Christ** in our hearts – You do not speak on Your own initiative, but You take of what is Christ’s and disclose it to us (John 16:13–14). It is You who opened our blind eyes to see the beauty of Jesus. **We were dead in sin, and You made us alive.** *“That which is born of the Spirit is spirit”* (John 3:6, NASB); *“the Spirit gives life”* (2 Corinthians 3:6). All praise to You for causing us to be *“born again”* (John 3:5) – regenerating our hearts, pouring the love of God into us (Romans 5:5), and testifying that we are God’s children (Romans 8:16). O Holy Spirit, **we adore You as the Sanctifier** of the saints. You are the One who convicts the world concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment (John 16:8). In each of us who believe, it was **Your voice** that first pierced our conscience and pointed us to Christ. And having brought us to Christ, You now work to make us like Christ. *“From glory to glory”* You transform us into His image by Your power (2 Corinthians 3:18). **We thank You, Spirit of holiness, for patiently purging sin from our lives.** You dwell within us – how sacred and astounding this truth is! Our bodies are a temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19). You intercede for us with groanings too deep for words (Romans 8:26), helping us in our weakness when we don’t know how to pray. You bear fruit in us – love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control (Galatians 5:22–23) – none of which we could produce on our own. By **Your power** we put to death the deeds of the body (Romans 8:13). By **Your guidance** we walk in newness of life. *“For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God”* (Romans 8:14, NASB). We honor You, Holy Spirit, for **sealing us** for the day of redemption (Ephesians 4:30). You are the **pledge of our inheritance** (Ephesians 1:13–14), the down payment guaranteeing that God will complete what He started in us. You unite us to Christ and to one another in the one Body. You distribute gifts to each believer as You will (1 Corinthians 12:11) for the building up of the Church – and thus **we glorify You for every gift and manifestation of Your presence** among us. We reverence Your holiness: how careful we must be not to *“grieve the Holy Spirit of God”* (Ephesians 4:30, NASB) by whom we were sealed. You are *“holy”* – You cannot abide sin in Your temple. Yet when we do sin, it is You who brings us to godly sorrow and back to the cross for cleansing. Thank You, gentle Spirit, for striving with us and not abandoning us. **Divine Spirit, we worship You** for indwelling us individually and corporately. Without You, we would have no connection to Christ or the Father; with You, *“the love of God has been poured out within our hearts”* (Romans 5:5, NASB). Truly, *“where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty”* (2 Corinthians 3:17, NASB) – freedom from bondage and adoption as God’s children. We bow in awe that the infinite God makes His home in us by Your presence, O Spirit of Christ. **Be glorified in us** – fill us, use us, and bring forth worship through us to the Triune God.

O God – Father, Son, and Holy Spirit – <b>You are our salvation and our hope.</b> We have seen in this book that salvation is not a light thing or a human work, but entirely <b>the work of You, the living God</b>. From eternity past, Father, You foreknew and loved a people; in time, Lord Jesus, You lived, died, and rose to purchase those people; and in our personal lives, Holy Spirit, You applied that redemption by calling us to repentance and faith. <b>All glory for our salvation belongs to You, our God.</b> We contributed nothing but our need; <b>You gave everything, and You continue to give and to sustain us in grace.</b> We acknowledge that apart from Your empowering, we are helpless. We declared in earlier chapters the sober truth that a believer can shipwreck his faith through willful sin – but even the perseverance to <i>remain</i> in Christ comes from <b>Your gracious hand</b>, O God. Thus we end not on a note of our resolve, but of <b>Your keeping power</b>. <i>“The LORD is faithful, and He will strengthen and protect you from the evil one”</i> (2 Thessalonians 3:3, NASB). We rest not in ourselves, but in <b>Your promise</b>: <i>“He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus”</i> (Philippians 1:6, NASB). We take comfort that <b>You are able to keep us from stumbling</b>. In the words of Scripture we offer doxology: <i>“Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, and to make you stand in the presence of His glory blameless with great joy, <b>to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion and authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen</b>”[<sup>nasb.literalword.com</sup></i>](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=Jude+1%3A24-25#:~:text=24%20Now%20to%20Him%20who,Amen)</i>.

**All praise to You, Almighty God!** You are **holy, holy, holy** – and by **Your grace**, we who were unholy have been made holy in Christ. You are **just** – and by Jesus’s atonement, we are justified. You are full of **wrath** against sin – and yet full of **mercy** toward sinners in Christ, having satisfied wrath on the cross. You are **patient** – not willing that any should perish – and You are **powerful to save** to the uttermost those who draw near to You through Jesus. Your **power to judge** is matched by Your power to redeem and transform. We therefore stand in awe of You. We desire our lives and eternal destinies to resound to **Your glory alone**. Let every saved soul be a trophy of Your grace and every judgment demonstrate the righteousness of Your justice. As we conclude this work, let its every warning and exhortation drive us to exalt **You**, the Triune God.

With profound reverence and love, we declare: **Yours, O Lord, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty** (1 Chronicles 29:11). There is none like You. *“From You and through You and to You are all things. To You be the glory forever. Amen”* (Romans 11:36, NASB).
