The purpose of this book is plain and urgent: <b>to warn believers that continuing in known sin, such as pornography or drunkenness, puts their salvation in jeopardy.</b> Scripture gives no guarantee that a person delaying repentance will find it later. <i>“Today if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts”</i> (Hebrews 3:15, NASB) – this plea rings out because tomorrow is not promised. God’s word insists that <b>now</b> is the time to repent and obey, <i>“Behold, now is ‘the acceptable time,’ behold, now is ‘the day of salvation’”[<sup>biblehub.com</sup></i>](https://biblehub.com/nasb/2_corinthians/6-2.htm#:~:text=NASB%201995%20for%20He%20says%2C,THE%20DAY%20OF%20SALVATION)</i>. A Christian who persists in willful sin is presuming on God’s grace and <b>may awaken too late</b> to the reality that grace does not excuse ongoing disobedience. Many will be lost because they misapply doctrines like <i>sola fide</i> (faith alone) or <i>“once saved, always saved,”</i> imagining that a one-time profession of faith or a general love of sound doctrine will save them even as they <i>“go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth”</i> – a choice for which <i>“there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins”[<sup>nasb.literalword.com</sup></i>](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=Hebrews+10%3A26-39#:~:text=26%20For%20if%20we%20go,a%20terrifying%20thing%20to%20fall)</i>. The loving but firm warning of this book is that we must not deceive ourselves: <b>continued rebellion, even under the banner of Christianity, leads to eternal death</b>. <i>“If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit”</i> (Galatians 5:25 NASB); if instead we make peace with sin, we risk being severed from Christ. Repent now, while God’s patience calls out to you.

To impress the urgency of repentance, consider two realistic scenarios of believers who *“misunderstand grace”* and delay turning from their sin:

**Scenario 1 – The “Struggling” Young Christian:** A young man in his twenties loves theology and confidently champions *sola fide* – the doctrine that we are justified by faith alone. He is active in his church and delights in sound teaching. Outwardly, his life seems orderly. Inwardly, however, he battles a secret pattern of viewing pornography. He tells himself he’s *“struggling”* with this sin, as if the mere internal conflict were enough. After each lapse into lust, guilt floods his heart. He earnestly prays for forgiveness, confessing his sin to God with tears in his eyes. Yet he has done this **dozens or even hundreds** of times. By now a troubling routine has set in: temptation – failure – remorse – a promise to do better – and then a return to the same mire.

This young Christian truly believes in Jesus and cherishes the gospel of grace. He remembers that <i>“by grace [we] have been saved through faith… not as a result of works”</i> (Ephesians 2:8–9, NASB)[<i><sup>nasb.literalword.com</sup></i>](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=Ephesians+2%3A8-10#:~:text=8%20For%20by%20grace%20you,we%20would%20walk%20in%20them). He reassures himself that he is <i>“not saved by moral perfection.”</i> When accusing thoughts arise – <i>“How can you be a Christian and keep doing this?”</i> – he counters them with promises of God’s love and patience. In his mind, his pornography habit is a <b>flaw</b> or a <i>“struggle common to many men,”</i> not an outright rebellion. He does not <b>defend</b> pornography; he despises it and feels ashamed. Yet in the quiet of his heart, he also does not <b>forsake</b> it. He believes he’ll eventually overcome it, perhaps through accountability or marriage, but he feels no urgency to cut off this sin immediately. After all (he reasons), <i>everyone struggles, and God understands</i>. He takes a kind of misguided comfort in calling himself <i>“a wretch saved by grace,”</i> as if repeatedly quoting <i>“no one is righteous, not even one”</i> could excuse remaining in known impurity. His doctrine has taught him to distrust any hint of “works-based salvation,” so he shies away from preaching that seems too hard on sin. When he hears a sermon on Jesus’s warning – <i>“if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it from you”</i> (Matthew 5:30 NASB) – he feels a stab of conviction. But soon he relaxes, thinking, <i>“I do hate my sin. I’m just not perfect yet. Thank God for grace. I’ll repent for real someday.”</i> In this way, he lulls his conscience with half-truths. He has <b>good theology in theory</b>, but he is blind to the gravity of practicing what God hates. In effect, he is <i>“receiving the grace of God in vain”</i> (2 Corinthians 6:1), presuming that grace means he can safely dabble in sin a little longer. What he fails to realize is that every indulgence hardens his heart and makes repentance more difficult. He is racing toward a spiritual crisis: unless he wakes up and <i>“puts to death the deeds of the body”</i> (Romans 8:13), his <b>faith will die</b>. Though he calls Jesus “Lord,” if he will not obey, he will not enter the Kingdom (cf. Matthew 7:21).

**Scenario 2 – The Complacent Older Believer:** An older man in his sixties has been a Christian for decades. He has served faithfully in the church, raised a family, and gained a reputation as a wise, mature believer. He can say with Paul, in a sense, *“I have fought the good fight… I have kept the faith”* (2 Timothy 4:7). Yet despite his fruitful past, he has allowed a particular sin to take root: from time to time, he drinks alcohol to excess, to the point of drunkenness. Perhaps a few times a year – at a wedding, a holiday, or alone in his home under stress – he overindulges and becomes intoxicated. He knows the Bible’s warnings against drunkenness. He has even gently admonished younger men about sobriety. But in his own case, he rationalizes: *“I’m no drunkard; it’s just occasional. I’m normally very self-controlled. This is a minor slip, not a lifestyle.”* He compares himself to true alcoholics or to his own wild youth, and by comparison he feels practically righteous. On nights when he stumbles to bed in a fog of alcohol, he wakes with a bitter conscience. He prays, *“Lord, forgive me. You know I love You. I won’t do that again.”* And for a long while, he doesn’t – until the next occasion months later. Each time, the conviction grows a little fainter. He still believes God is merciful and assumes these lapses won’t *“cost him eternal life.”* Why would they? He’s served God so long. *“Surely the Lord knows I’m but dust,”* he muses (alluding to Psalm 103:14). *“He won’t cast me away for this one weakness.”* In the back of his mind, he recalls the scripture, *“no drunkards... will inherit the kingdom of God,”* but he quickly assures himself that *that* refers to “drunkards” in the sense of habitual alcoholics – not a respectable, long-standing churchman like himself. So he continues in an unrepentant pattern, small in his own eyes but significant before God. This man, too, is on dangerous ground. He has ceased to *“bring forth fruit in keeping with repentance”* (Luke 3:8), instead trusting that a long record of past faithfulness will excuse present disobedience. He has forgotten that **each person’s ongoing choices determine their destiny**: *“if you live according to the flesh, you will die”* (Romans 8:13). His occasional drunkenness is eroding the very sobriety of spirit that he needs to persevere in faith. Unless he repents, he risks hearing Christ say, *“I never knew you; depart from Me”* on the Last Day (Matthew 7:23).

These scenarios are not exaggerations or caricatures. They reflect the real inner reasoning of many professing Christians. Both individuals genuinely <i>identify</i> as believers and even feel affection for God and confidence in doctrine. Yet both are tragically <b>misusing the grace of God</b>. The young man comforts himself with true doctrines (grace, faith, God’s patience) but falsely applies them as a cloak for ongoing immorality. The older man relies on his history of service as though it can balance out willful sin, effectively trusting his past religiosity to nullify God’s clear command to <b>stay sober</b>. In different ways, they each have succumbed to <i>“the deceitfulness of sin”</i> (Hebrews 3:13), which whispers that deliberate sin will not bring death. But God’s Word warns otherwise. Paul wrote bluntly to the Corinthian church that those who live in unrighteousness – including the sexually immoral and drunkards – <i>“will not inherit the kingdom of God.”</i> He added, <i>“Do not be deceived”[<sup>dailyverses.net</sup></i>](https://dailyverses.net/1-corinthians/6/9-10/nasb#:~:text=Or%20do%20you%20not%20know,inherit%20the%20kingdom%20of%20God)</i>. Likewise, to the Ephesians Paul insisted that no immoral or impure person has any inheritance in Christ’s kingdom, and he cautioned: <i>“Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience”[<sup>nasb.literalword.com](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=Ephesians+5%3A1-14#:~:text=coarse%20jesting%2C%20which%20are%20not,7%20Therefore%20do%20not%20be)[nasb.literalword.com</i></sup>](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=Ephesians+5%3A1-14#:~:text=is%20an%20idolater%2C%20has%20an,to%20speak%20of%20the%20things)</i>. The young man’s inner voice saying “it’s just a struggle, you’ll repent later” and the old man’s assurance “a little indulgence won’t matter” – these are exactly the <i>“empty words”</i> that deceive and damn souls. God is not mocked; <i>“whatever a man sows, this he will also reap”</i> (Galatians 6:7–8, NASB). <b>If a believer sows to please his flesh – persists in fleshly sin – he will reap corruption and destruction.</b> No pedigree of sound doctrine or years in church can shield one from God’s judgment if one abandons His commandments. As Peter writes, <i>“if after they have escaped the defilements of the world by the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ they are again entangled in them and are overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first”</i> (2 Peter 2:20 NASB). In other words, a believer who <b>returns to willful sin</b> faces even greater peril.

Dear reader, these warnings are given by God’s love. <i>“See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God”</i> (Hebrews 12:15), the Scripture urges – implying that it is indeed possible to “come short,” to <b>forfeit</b> the grace that was once received. We write with a pastoral burden, knowing that <i>“the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and many... enter through it”</i> (Matthew 7:13). Many of those on the broad road <i>think</i> they are heaven-bound. Some sit in pews, serve in ministry, and confess orthodox creeds, yet <b>cling to a favorite sin</b> under cover of complacency or presumption. But <i>“no creature is hidden from His sight”</i> (Hebrews 4:13). God sees the truth of our lives, and He will not abide rivals in our hearts. His grace is not a license to sin; it is power to live a holy life and the promise of forgiveness <i>conditioned upon repentance</i>. Jesus’s first and continual call is <i>“Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand”</i> (Matthew 4:17). <b>There is zero guarantee that one who refuses that call now will have opportunity later.</b> Esau discovered this to his horror: after selling his birthright for fleshly gratification, he later <i>“desired to inherit the blessing”</i> but <i>“was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought for it with tears”[<sup>nasb.literalword.com</sup></i>](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=Hebrews+12%3A15-17#:~:text=bitterness%20springing%20up%20causes%20trouble%2C,sought%20for%20it%20with%20tears)</i>. The young man with the secret porn habit assumes he can repent on his own timetable – but he may find, when the time comes, that his heart is too hardened to genuinely turn. The old man assumes he will die in comfort and enter glory – but he may find, to his shock, that <i>“the Master will come on a day he does not expect”</i> (Luke 12:46) and <i>“cut him in pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers”</i> (Luke 12:46, a fate Jesus warns will befall the unfaithful servant). These are not extreme outcomes reserved only for apostates and false brethren; <b>they are real possibilities for any believer who drifts into willful sin and refuses to repent</b>. God’s holiness demands it, and His justice will not bend. <i>“Without holiness... no one will see the Lord”</i> (Hebrews 12:14, NASB).

Therefore, as you begin this book, <b>examine yourself</b> in the light of God’s truth. Are you harboring a sin that you trivialize as <i>“just a struggle”</i> or <i>“just occasional”</i>? Do you subtly believe that being a Christian is a free pass for behavior you know Christ forbids? If so, hear the warning of the Holy Spirit: <i>“Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts”</i> (Hebrews 4:7, NASB). Do not bank on future repentance or greater resolve tomorrow – that is a deadly gamble. God’s word says <i>now</i> is the time to repent, <i>“now is ‘the day of salvation’”[<sup>biblehub.com</sup></i>](https://biblehub.com/nasb/2_corinthians/6-2.htm#:~:text=NASB%201995%20for%20He%20says%2C,THE%20DAY%20OF%20SALVATION)</i>. He is patient, indeed, <i>“not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance”[<sup>nasb.literalword.com</sup></i>](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=2+Peter+3%3A9#:~:text=9%20The%20Lord%20is%20not,all%20to%20come%20to%20repentance)</i>. Yet His patience has a purpose – to lead us to repentance <i>now</i> – and it will <b>not</b> excuse those who spurn it. <i>“Or do you think lightly of the riches of His kindness and tolerance and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?”</i> (Romans 2:4 NASB). The very grace you count on is pleading with you to turn from sin today. There is abundant mercy for the contrite heart, but for the stubborn and unrepentant, <i>“there will be wrath and fury”</i> (Romans 2:5).

In the chapters that follow, we will explore more deeply how and why true believers can forfeit salvation through unrepentant sin, examining the full counsel of Scripture on God’s grace, holiness, and judgment. This is not a theoretical issue – it is <b>eternally practical</b>. As these opening examples show, it is perilously easy to <i>feel</i> saved and secure while living in a way that God says leads to damnation. Our hope is that this book will awaken you to the <b>clear and present danger</b> of willful sin. <i>“Let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall”</i> (1 Corinthians 10:12, NASB). The loving voice of God calls out: <i>Repent!</i> Do not delay. <i>“Today, while you have the opportunity, turn and seek the Lord that He may have mercy”</i> (cf. Isaiah 55:6–7). <b>There may be no tomorrow.</b> <i>“It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God”</i> (Hebrews 10:31, NASB)[<i><sup>nasb.literalword.com</sup></i>](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=Hebrews+10%3A26-39#:~:text=who%20has%20trampled%20under%20foot,hands%20of%20the%20living%20God), but it is a wonderful thing to fall to your knees in humble repentance now, while His arms are still open. May the Spirit of God grant you ears to hear this urgent call. Eternal life is at stake.
