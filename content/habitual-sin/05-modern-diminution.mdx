**Abstract:** Modern churches—**even those outwardly thriving in faith—have subtly diminished the urgent warnings against sin that characterized the early Christian community.** This chapter explores how many contemporary evangelical churches have softened or altogether removed cautions about post-conversion sin, especially sexual immorality like pornography. A prevailing confidence in doctrines such as “once saved, always saved” or a misconstrued form of “perseverance of the saints” has contributed to an atmosphere where believers feel **eternally secure regardless of their conduct.** By examining sermons, teachings, and denominational statements from widely respected evangelical sources (rather than fringe or “easy targets”), we will see how warnings of judgment for believers persisting in sin have been toned down or ignored. This stands in stark contrast to the early church’s frank admonitions and rigorous call to purity. The chapter will cite examples from influential modern pastors and official church doctrines to illustrate this softening. Ultimately, it argues that this **modern diminution** of holiness and warning not only departs from apostolic precedent, but also endangers souls by lulling professing believers into a false sense of security despite ongoing sinful practices. *(All Scripture quotations are from the NASB.)*
