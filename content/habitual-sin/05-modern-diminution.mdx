# Chapter 5: Modern Diminution

*Why modern churches often whisper what Scripture shouts.*

## Coming Soon

This chapter will examine how and why the modern church has largely abandoned the clear biblical warnings about habitual sin. We will explore:

### Historical Shifts
- The rise of "easy believism" and decisional theology
- Misunderstandings of grace that minimize holiness
- The influence of psychology on pastoral counseling
- Cultural accommodation in church teaching

### Theological Errors
- **Antinomianism** - The belief that grace eliminates moral obligation
- **Cheap Grace** - Dietrich Bonhoeffer's warnings about grace without discipleship
- **Once Saved, Always Saved** - How this doctrine is often misapplied
- **Therapeutic Gospel** - Making people feel better rather than calling them to repentance

### Modern Consequences
- Declining moral standards in the church
- Lack of church discipline
- Confusion about assurance of salvation
- Pastoral fear of offending congregants

### The Need for Recovery
- Returning to biblical preaching
- Restoring church discipline
- Emphasizing both grace and holiness
- Calling believers to serious self-examination

*"For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers."* (<BibleVerse reference="2 Timothy 4:3-4" />)
