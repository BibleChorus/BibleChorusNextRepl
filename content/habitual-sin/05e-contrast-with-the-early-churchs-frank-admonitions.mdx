**How different is this from the early church!** The Christians of the first centuries, including the New Testament authors, **did not hesitate to link immoral conduct with eternal destiny** in their preaching and teaching. Far from assuming that every baptized person would make it to heaven regardless of behavior, they frequently warned believers of the real possibility of falling away and facing judgment.

In the New Testament itself, we see Paul writing to the <b>Corinthian church</b>, a community of baptized believers, reminding them bluntly: <i>“Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers… will inherit the kingdom of God.”[<sup>bible.com</sup></i>](https://www.bible.com/bible/100/1CO.6.9-10.NASB1995#:~:text=Or%20do%20you%20not%20know,inherit%20the%20kingdom%20of%20God)</i>. This “do not be deceived” implies that Christians <b>are in danger of deceiving themselves on this point</b>—thinking perhaps that grace gives them a pass. Paul will have none of it. He effectively says: make no mistake, if you practice these sins, you will not be saved. Similarly, the author of Hebrews includes himself among believers when he warns, <i>“If we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a terrifying expectation of judgment”</i> (Heb. 10:26–27). Such language was meant to instill <b>godly fear</b> and prompt self-examination.

Early post-biblical writings continue in the same vein. The <i>Didache</i> (c. A.D. 70-90), a church manual for new converts, urged Christians to be ever watchful, for, <i>“the whole time of your faith will not profit you, if you are not made complete in the last time.”[<sup>earlychristianwritings.com</sup></i>](https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/didache-roberts.html#:~:text=Chapter%2016,do%20signs%20and%20wonders%2C%20and)</i> In other words, it’s not how you start but how you finish; early faith means nothing if one falls away before the end. The <i>Shepherd of Hermas</i> (late 1st or mid-2nd century), an immensely popular Christian text in its time, teaches that those believers who <b>do not repent of their sins “shall utterly perish,”</b> and even one who has entered the church but “relapse[s]” into strife and disunity <i>“will be cast out of the tower [the Church], and will lose his life.”</i> It concludes, <b>“Life is the possession of all who keep the commandments of the Lord.”[<i><sup>catholic.com</sup></i>](https://www.catholic.com/tract/mortal-sin#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAnd%20as%20many%20of%20them,A.D.%2080)</b>. Note that keeping the Lord’s commandments (i.e. obeying Him) is seen as the condition for retaining “life” (salvation). That is a far cry from <i>“you can sin like the devil and not lose your salvation”</i>.

St. <b>Justin Martyr</b> (c. 156 AD) wrote that <i>“eternal fire was prepared for him who <b>voluntarily departed</b> from God, and for all who, <b>without repentance, persevere in apostasy</b>.”[<sup>catholic.com</sup></i>](https://www.catholic.com/tract/mortal-sin#:~:text=Justin%20Martyr)</i>. Here a Church Father teaches clearly that someone who had been with God (a Christian) can depart voluntarily and end up in eternal fire if they persist in that state without repentance. This shows the early Christians firmly believed a true believer <b>could indeed walk away and be lost</b>. Even the theologian Augustine, often cited by later Calvinists, taught that many receive God’s grace initially but do not persevere to the end (he distinguished between initial grace and the gift of perseverance). The early church simply <b>did not share the modern security-complacency</b>; they considered the race of faith something one could fail to finish.

They also implemented <b>church discipline</b> for moral sins, something often missing now. For example, if a man in the early church was found to be using prostitutes or indulging sexual immorality (like the man in 1 Corinthians 5 who had to be expelled), he would be removed from fellowship, not coddled. Repentance was often formal and at times lengthy. Tertullian (c. 203 AD) remarks how some, out of shame, <i>“put off [confessing their sin] from day to day… and thus they perish along with their own bashfulness”[<sup>catholic.com</sup></i>](https://www.catholic.com/tract/mortal-sin#:~:text=Tertullian)</i>. The assumption is that <b>refusing to repent and confess sin leads to spiritual perishing</b>. Contrast that with today, where one might sit in church for years with a hidden porn addiction and never be confronted or even directly challenged from the pulpit to confess and repent—or risk perishing.

Early Christian leaders spoke of certain grave sins (later termed “mortal sins”) that would <b>kill the life of grace in the soul</b> if not absolved. They didn’t delineate these out of legalism, but because they saw the spiritual devastation such sins caused. The concept of <b>“mortal sin”</b> – a sin that, if willfully continued, results in spiritual death – was universally accepted. As one summary puts it, <i>“The early Church Fathers were unanimous in teaching the reality of mortal sin… they recognized that it was possible to lose the grace of salvation after baptism.”[<sup>catholic.com](https://www.catholic.com/tract/mortal-sin#:~:text=Fortunately%2C%20most%20Christians%20today%20reject,the%20reality%20of%20mortal%20sin)[catholic.com</i></sup>](https://www.catholic.com/tract/mortal-sin#:~:text=They%20had%20to%20embrace%20the,grace%20of%20salvation%20after%20baptism)</i>. This was simply taken for granted in discipleship: a baptized believer who later committed idolatry, sexual immorality, or murder, for example, would be understood to have cut themselves off from Christ and must be restored only through sincere repentance (if at all). No one would argue “perhaps he was never really saved”; they would focus on the clear fact that he is in peril <i>now</i> and needs to return to grace.

One vivid illustration of how seriously sin was taken is the practice in some early communities of allowing *one* post-baptismal repentance for major sins (a view associated with Hermas and later Novatian rigorists). While the broader church did not dogmatically limit repentance, the very existence of that idea shows how costly a second fall was considered. Today’s church, by contrast, often treats repeated falls into egregious sin as almost expected, endlessly saying “we’re all broken” without urgently calling for transformation. **The early Christians feared sin; many modern Christians merely fret about it.**

Perhaps most telling is the tone of **urgency and eternity** in early Christian exhortations. **They constantly had eternity in view.** Modern preaching, by softening warnings, has largely shifted the focus to the here-and-now benefits of Christianity (peace, purpose, community) rather than the stark realities of heaven and hell. The early church could not afford such complacency; they faced persecution, and they believed deeply that **to deny Christ—whether under pressure or for worldly pleasure—was to imperil one’s soul.** They heeded Jesus’ own words: *“Whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father”* (Matt. 10:33). They remembered that even an anointed figure like King David, had he not repented of his adultery and murder, would have been lost. Thus, they wove warnings into their teaching naturally.

We see, then, a **dramatic divergence**: The early church **majored on holiness and warnings** while still offering grace to the repentant; much of the modern church **majors on positional grace and neglects to warn**, assuming (often wrongly) that warnings are implicitly understood. The result? **A churchgoer in A.D. 150 likely knew that falling into serious sin without repentance meant damnation**, whereas a churchgoer in 2025 might think falling into serious sin will merely reduce their joy or rewards—but not endanger their salvation.
