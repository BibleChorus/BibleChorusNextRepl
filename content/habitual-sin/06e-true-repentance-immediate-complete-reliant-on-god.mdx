**What does God require of the sinner?** In a word, repent! But repentance in the biblical sense is a rich concept involving the whole person—mind, heart, and will. It is not a process that earns forgiveness (forgiveness is a free gift through Christ’s atonement), but it is the *necessary response* to truly receive that forgiveness. We have emphasized it must be *thorough*. Now let’s break down some qualities of true repentance:

**1. Immediate – Do not delay.** The moment you become aware of sin, the time to repent is *now*. *“Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts”* (Heb. 3:15). The longer one stays in sin, the harder the heart can become, and tomorrow is promised to no one. Immediate repentance means you don’t toy with half-measures or say, “I’ll taper off my sin gradually.” For example, if convicted about pornography, one shouldn’t decide, “I’ll stop after a few more indulgences” or “I’ll quit next month when it’s more convenient.” **Delayed obedience is disobedience.** The prodigal son didn’t finish out his harlots and then return; once he “came to himself,” he got up at once and went to his father. There is urgency in Scripture’s calls: *“Seek the Lord while He may be found; call upon Him while He is near. Let the wicked forsake his way… let him return to the Lord”* (Isa. 55:6–7). The implication is, there comes a time when God may *not* be found—i.e., opportunity lost, or heart too dull to respond. So do it now, this very day. Burn the bridges to your sin immediately. There is a story of early church converts who, upon baptism, would sometimes publicly burn their occult scrolls or idols (as in Acts 19:18–19). Likewise, a modern believer might delete his stash of illicit files, flush drugs, break ungodly ties, **the very hour** they repent—so there is no turning back. That kind of prompt action both proves and reinforces the sincerity of repentance.

**2. Complete – Holding nothing back.** Partial repentance will not do. This doesn’t mean you instantly become aware of every sin in your life; God often reveals layer by layer. But it means with respect to what you *do* know, you conceal nothing and yield everything. You don’t say, “Lord, I’ll give up porn but still harbor bitterness,” or “I’ll stop cheating on my taxes but not going to give up my porn.” We cannot negotiate with God, turning over one sin while keeping another. The heart of repentance is **full surrender**: “Lord, I put my whole self on your altar—do with me as You will. Correct everything in me that grieves You.” Often one big sin is the focus, but true repentance of that will bleed into other areas. It’s like pulling a nasty weed—if you really pull the root, other entangled roots come out too. If you just break off the top, the root stays. Therefore, aim at the root: a heart that says yes to sin must become a heart that says yes to God. Specific actions will follow accordingly.

Complete repentance also means you don’t deliberately leave any open doors. For instance, someone might say they repent of an emotional affair with a coworker, yet they “need” to continue working closely with that person and just try to manage their feelings. If the situation is causing you to sin, radical action (like changing jobs) may be needed. Cutting off sin at the source can be painful, but it’s part of that “plucking out the eye” Jesus spoke of.

**3. Humble – Confession and brokenness.** Repentance involves **confessing** our sins to God and, when appropriate, to others. *“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us”* (1 John 1:9). Confession means to “agree with” – we agree with God’s verdict on our sin (no minimizing, no blaming others). It’s important in prayer to name the sin specifically: not just “I messed up,” but “Lord, I have committed adultery in my heart by viewing pornography. I have been unfaithful to You and (if married) to my spouse. I have indulged lust; I have exposed my mind to filth; I have contributed to an industry that exploits and defiles others. Forgive me.” Specific confession cultivates true contrition. David’s Psalm 51 is a model—he says *“Against You, You only, have I sinned and done what is evil in Your sight”* and *“Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God”* (for his murder of Uriah). He owns even the worst of his crimes. And he is **broken-hearted**: *“The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise.”* (Ps. 51:17). We too must come with that broken spirit. Not that we have to manufacture emotion, but we should pray for godly sorrow if we lack it: “Lord, break my heart over my sin—let me see it as You do.” When God grants tears of repentance, they are precious.

Confession to others is also vital in many cases. James 5:16 says *“Confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another so that you may be healed.”* This doesn’t mean broadcasting to everyone, but it means we shouldn’t keep our sin in solitary darkness. Bringing it into the light with a trusted brother or sister or pastor is often the moment when its power breaks. It’s humbling (pride hates to admit fault), but that humility is exactly what we need. God gives grace to the humble (James 4:6). If you’ve been struggling alone, *resolve not to remain alone*. Find a mature Christian friend or leader, and confess your struggle and desire to repent. Not only will this keep you accountable, it’s also biblical: the early church practiced public or semi-public confession for serious sins, and they found it medicinal for the soul. It guards against self-deception and half-hearted measures because now someone else knows and can ask you how you’re doing. It also invites the church community into your healing process, even if it’s just one or two others at first.

Also, if your sin directly harmed others (e.g., marital unfaithfulness, lying to someone, stealing), **complete repentance includes seeking their forgiveness and making restitution where possible.** Zacchaeus, upon repenting, immediately declared he’d pay back fourfold anyone he defrauded (Luke 19:8). That was fruit of repentance. If you’ve lied to your spouse about your porn use, repentance likely means sitting down and confessing the truth, painful as that may be, and seeking their forgiveness and help to change. This can be extremely hard, but it’s often the turning point from darkness to light in the marriage. The breach of trust needs addressing so that true healing can happen. Likewise, if one’s sin has been public scandal, a public apology may be in order. These acts of contrition do not earn forgiveness from God (Christ’s blood alone does that), but they are the fitting **fruits** of repentance (Luke 3:8) and they help to straighten what was twisted by our sin.

**4. Reliant on God’s power – saturated in prayer and Word.** As we’ve stressed, repentance is not merely a human endeavor. **It is a collaboration with grace.** One of the most important things a repentant person can do is **pray** continually for deliverance and strength. Jesus urged His disciples, *“Watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation”* (Matt. 26:41). In practical terms, that means keeping a very active prayer life, especially surrounding your areas of weakness. Do not trust yourself. If you must be on a business trip with an empty hotel room (a common temptation scenario for some), don’t just white-knuckle it—pray before, during, and after. Ask others to pray for you too.

Fill your mind with Scripture. The Psalmist said, *“Your word I have treasured in my heart, that I may not sin against You”* (Ps. 119:11). There are specific scriptures that directly counter lust, greed, anger, etc. Find them, memorize them, meditate on them daily. When Jesus was tempted by Satan, He responded with Scripture each time: *“It is written…”* This shows us the sword of the Spirit must be unsheathed in battle. For example, if lust is the issue, memorize verses like *“Flee youthful lusts”* (2 Tim. 2:22) or *“I have made a covenant with my eyes; how then could I gaze at a virgin?”* (Job 31:1) or *“Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God”* (Matt. 5:8). Quote them when temptation arises. There is supernatural power in the Word to renew our mind. Over time, where lustful images once dominated, now God’s Word will. But it takes repetition and intentionality—literally reprogramming our thinking by truth (Rom. 12:2).

<b>5. Immediate in effect – experiencing God’s forgiveness instantly.</b> It’s important to know that the moment repentance (coupled with faith) is genuine, God’s forgiveness is granted. We may still <i>feel</i> guilty or unworthy for a time, but positionally, if you have turned back to God, He <i>has</i> already embraced you. Think of the prodigal son: as soon as he started his confession, the father was already hugging him and ordering the robe and ring (Luke 15:20–22). God does not humiliate us or put us on probation: <i>“There is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus”</i> (Rom. 8:1). So while the process of breaking sin’s habits takes time, the reception of mercy is immediate upon repentance. This is vital, because sometimes people languish in unnecessary guilt even after confessing. The enemy may whisper, “God doesn’t want you back, not after what you did. You need to wallow longer.” No, friend. Jesus’s blood is sufficient. The promise is: <i>“If we confess… He will forgive and cleanse”[<sup>bible.lockman.org](https://bible.lockman.org/htm_php-c.php?do=show_node&b=67&c=0&v=0&show_ti=2966&show_ts=1&show_user_id=ca7a55acd81d7f5cdd0c6cff2c0bc96e&show_question_id=17377#:~:text=,Security%3A%20Can%20You%20Be%20Sure)[bible.lockman.org</i></sup>](https://bible.lockman.org/htm_php-c.php?do=show_node&b=67&c=0&v=0&show_ti=2966&show_ts=1&show_user_id=ca7a55acd81d7f5cdd0c6cff2c0bc96e&show_question_id=17377#:~:text=,Security%2C%20Can%20You%20Be%20Sure)</i>. We must trust that promise, not our emotions. Part of repentance is believing God’s word about forgiveness. Some ironically need to repent of unbelief in God’s mercy, holding their sin as if it’s too special to be forgiven. True humility accepts forgiveness gratefully.

**6. Ongoing and enduring – a new lifestyle.** Finally, true repentance is not a one-time act but the **beginning of a new walk**. The Greek word for repentance *metanoia* literally means “change of mind,” and the Hebrew concept *teshuva* means “returning” (to God). Both convey a permanent change of direction. Imagine walking westward (toward sin) and then turning to walk eastward (toward God). That’s repentance. But if a person “repents” for a week and then goes right back, that wasn’t genuine—the direction didn’t truly change, it was a brief detour.

Jesus said, *“No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God”* (Luke 9:62). The call to repentance is a call to **persevere** in a new direction to the end. Matthew 24:13: *“the one who endures to the end, he will be saved.”* This does not mean our endurance merits salvation, but it evidences it. So, part of our counsel is: *Make up your mind that by God’s grace, you will never go back.* Burn the ships, like Cortés arriving in the New World, so there’s no retreat. If you do fall, you get up and resume forward, you do not capitulate and say “I guess I can’t do this.” The proverb says *“Though a righteous man falls seven times, he rises again.”* (Prov. 24:16). We have to adopt that tenacity. Some days will be harder than others. Some temptations will surge when you least expect. Endure. *“You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood in your striving against sin,”* Hebrews 12:4 reminds us—implying, keep striving, it’s worth the fight.

God’s promise to those who repent and *continue* in His ways is sure: they will find life. Jesus told the church in Smyrna, *“Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life”* (Rev. 2:10). And to the one in Thyatira who was compromising, He said if they overcome, they will rule with Him (Rev. 2:26–27). In every case, **repentance restored to favor and reward, but it had to be maintained.**

This is where **reliance on God** remains critical. If I consider enduring in my own strength, I despair. But if I trust that *“He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus”* (Phil. 1:6), then I have confidence that as I abide in Christ daily, He will see me through. Jude’s doxology encourages us that God *“is able to keep you from stumbling”* (Jude 24). We must lean on that ability, not ours.

So, repent immediately and completely, continue steadfastly, and lean wholly on the Lord all along. That is the blueprint. Now, what does this look like in community, and how can we practically encourage and sustain a repentant life? We turn to the example of the early church and some practical tools like liturgies and reflective practices.
