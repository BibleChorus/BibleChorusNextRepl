To address this modern shortfall, we must reclaim the **apostolic balance of comfort and warning**. After all, the same Paul who told believers nothing could separate them from Christ’s love (Rom. 8:38–39) also told believers to “work out your salvation with fear and trembling” (Phil. 2:12). The early church managed to preach both. We can too, but it requires conviction and courage.

First, pastors and teachers must **firmly believe what the Scriptures say about the eternal stakes**. We must accept that warnings addressed to believers are not hypothetical. They are meant to be taken at face value: if *we* (born-again, Spirit-filled people) live after the flesh, *we* will die (Rom. 8:13); if *we* deny Him, *He will deny us* (2 Tim. 2:12); if *we* do not persevere, *we* will not inherit the promise (Heb. 10:36–39). Once church leaders let these truths grip them personally, they can preach with authenticity.

Second, our preaching and teaching should regularly include loving warnings alongside invitations. This need not be done with an angry or judgmental tone; it can be done tearfully, pleading like Paul who warned the Ephesian elders for *“three years… night and day with tears”* (Acts 20:31). Warnings actually **strengthen** the impact of grace. When people grasp the danger of sin, the **grace of forgiveness and power to overcome sin becomes all the more amazing**. In eras of revival, preachers like John Wesley or Charles Finney would convict the conscience with God’s law and warnings, then offer the sweet gospel solution. That pattern produces true converts who flee from sin to Christ, rather than half-converts who merely add Christ to their sin.

Third, churches should consider restoring **church discipline and accountability** structures, particularly regarding pervasive issues like pornography. When 50-70% of the men (and many women) in a congregation are ensnared in a sin that Scripture says can bar one from the Kingdom, something is terribly wrong. It calls for a radical, public response—special times of repentance, accountability groups, pastoral oversight of those struggling, perhaps even withholding leadership roles or membership privileges until repentance is evident (always in a spirit of restoration, per Gal. 6:1). This is uncomfortable, yes. But which is worse: to discomfort people now, or for them to hear on Judgment Day, *“I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness”* (Matt. 7:23)? The early Christians chose temporary discomfort (confession, penance, discipline) to avert eternal tragedy. We should do the same, guided by Scripture and love.

Finally, we as a modern church must repent for our **“Laodicean”** lukewarmness. Jesus rebuked the church at Laodicea for thinking they were rich and in need of nothing, not realizing they were wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked (Rev. 3:15–17). In many ways, that is us. We assume all is well because our churches are full and programs running. But if we have lost the *saline edge* of holiness and the *fire* of urgency, we are lukewarm. Jesus’ counsel to Laodicea was to *“be zealous and repent”* (Rev. 3:19). We can take that to heart. We must repent of fearing man more than God, repent of the laziness that let difficult doctrines slide, and repent of the lack of love that failed to warn our brothers and sisters of danger.

**Modern diminution of warnings is not irreversible.** Already, there are signs of some awakening. Some ministries now speak frankly about pornography and call for purity. Some pastors are re-preaching neglected texts about judgment. Believers disillusioned with shallow Christianity are reading the early Church Fathers and discovering that robust call to holiness. These are hopeful signs. Yet much more is needed for a broad course-correction.

In conclusion, the church today finds itself at a pivotal moment similar to the Old Testament watchman on the wall (Ezekiel 33). God told Ezekiel that if the watchman sees the sword coming and fails to blow the trumpet, the people’s blood will be on the watchman’s head. But if he blows the warning and any refuse to heed, then he is not guilty of their blood. Right now, **the swords of sin and judgment are drawn against the church from within and without.** Many leaders have not blown the trumpet of warning for fear of disturbing the peace. This chapter has attempted to show the deadly folly of that approach. **We must blow the trumpet clearly once again.** We must declare to the baptized: *“Brothers and sisters, make no mistake—those who practice sexual immorality, impurity, greed, deceit, etc., will not inherit God’s kingdom. If you have fallen into these, flee from the wrath to come by fleeing to Christ anew in repentance!”* This is not contrary to the gospel; it *is part of* the gospel call.

By restoring these warnings about sin after conversion, we actually honor the true grace of God. For as the apostle Paul wrote to Titus, *“the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all people, **instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires** and to live sensibly, righteously and godly in the present age”* (Titus 2:11–12, emphasis added). Grace instructs us to deny sin, not to tolerate it. **Modern preaching must reconnect grace with its instructing, transforming power.** In doing so, the church will regain the holy vibrancy of its first love, speaking with one voice the full counsel of God: promise and warning, mercy and judgment, comfort and challenge. With the air thus cleared, those who persist in sin will hear the alarm and have the opportunity to truly repent, and those who are walking in the light will be sobered and all the more watchful to remain faithful. This sets the stage for the next chapter, which moves from diagnosis to prescription: a direct **call to repentance and hope** for all who have found themselves ensnared in sin’s web, and a roadmap to restoration for the wandering soul.
