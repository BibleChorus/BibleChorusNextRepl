Moving to the late 1st century, we have a letter known as **1 Clement**, traditionally ascribed to *Clement of Rome* (c. AD 96), written to the Corinthian church. Clement was concerned with a schism in Corinth, but along the way, he exhorts the believers to **repent of envy and strife** and pursue humility and obedience. Clement clearly believes that **fearing God and maintaining good works are necessary to avoid God’s judgment**. For example:

*“Since, therefore, all things are seen and heard by Him, let us fear Him and abandon the filthy desires for evil deeds, that we may be sheltered by His mercy from the judgments to come.”[<sup>earlychristianwritings.com](https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/1clement-hoole.html#:~:text=CHAPTER%2028)[earlychristianwritings.com*</sup>](https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/1clement-hoole.html#:~:text=28%3A1%20Since%2C%20therefore%2C%20all%20things,from%20the%20judgments%20to%20come)*

Here Clement urges the church to <i>fear God</i>, turn away from any <i>“filthy desires”</i> and sinful deeds, precisely so that they may obtain mercy and not condemnation in the coming Judgment. This echoes the New Testament call to <i>cleanse ourselves from defilement out of fear of God</i> (2 Cor 7:1). Clement doesn’t take it for granted that all in the church will automatically escape judgment; rather, <b>they must persevere in holiness to find mercy</b>. If some in Corinth were harboring envy or rebellion (as the letter indicates), Clement warns that failing to repent would put them in grave danger: <i>“we shall incur no slight harm, but rather great danger, if we… estrange us from that which is good”</i> he writes[<i><sup>earlychristianwritings.com](https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/1clement-hoole.html#:~:text=14%3A1%20It%20is%20therefore%20meet,are%20leaders%20of%20detestable%20sedition)[earlychristianwritings.com</i></sup>](https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/1clement-hoole.html#:~:text=14%3A2%20For%20we%20shall%20incur,from%20that%20which%20is%20good).

Clement also emphasizes that being God’s people entails **living up to that calling**. He reminds them:

*“Let us, therefore, approach Him with holiness of spirit, lifting unto Him pure and undefiled hands… Since, therefore, we are a portion of the Holy One, let us do all such things as pertain to holiness, avoiding evil-speaking, foul and impure embraces, drunkenness, disorderliness, abominable desires, detestable adultery… justified by our deeds, and not by our words.”[<sup>earlychristianwritings.com](https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/1clement-hoole.html#:~:text=29%3A1%20Let%20us%2C%20therefore%2C%20approach,a%20part%20of%20his%20elect)[earlychristianwritings.com*</sup>](https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/1clement-hoole.html#:~:text=30%3A1%20Since%2C%20therefore%2C%20we%20are,desires%2C%20detestable%20adultery%2C%20execrable%20pride)*

Observe several things in this exhortation. Clement bases ethical living on identity: <i>“we are a portion of the Holy One”</i> (God’s people), therefore we must <i>“do all things that pertain to holiness.”</i> He then explicitly lists <i>avoiding</i> things like foul embraces (likely sexual sin), <b>drunkenness</b>, <b>lust (“abominable desires”), and adultery</b>, among others. If members of the church were engaging in any of those, Clement’s instruction is to <b>stop</b> – holiness admits no such practices. Strikingly, he says we are <i>“justified by our deeds, and not by our words.”</i> This is not a denial of justification by faith; rather, in context, Clement means that our <b>true righteousness is demonstrated in actions, not in mere talk[<i><sup>earlychristianwritings.com](https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/1clement-hoole.html#:~:text=30%3A2%20for%20God%2C%20he%20saith%2C,giveth%20grace%20unto%20the%20humble)[earlychristianwritings.com</i></sup>](https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/1clement-hoole.html#:~:text=30%3A3%20Let%20us%20cleave%2C%20therefore%2C,and%20not%20by%20our%20words)</b>. It’s akin to James saying <i>“I will show you my faith by my works”</i> (James 2:18). Many might <i>claim</i> to be righteous (the Corinthian schismatics likely claimed to be in the right), but Clement reminds them that <b>God’s verdict (“justified”) in the end will accord with how we actually lived</b>. If our <i>deeds</i> are wicked, no mere <i>words</i> or affiliations will save us. This implies that a person calling himself a Christian yet living in “detestable adultery” or the like will <b>not be acquitted</b> in the judgment – regardless of any claims.

1 Clement also alludes to Scripture examples of those who sinned and were punished (like the Israelites). He takes these as warnings. For instance, he cites <i>“God’s declaration: ‘If they shall forsake My law… I will visit their offenses with a rod’”[<sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L151%20such%20as,a%20rod%2C%20and%20their%20sins)</i> – indicating that even God’s chosen ones (Israel) did not escape punishment if they forsook His commands. The implication for the church is that <b>we too will face God’s rod if we turn from His way</b>. Clement specifically states, <i>“We should fear the Lord and keep His commandments, lest we fall away like the wilderness generation.”</i> The letter frequently calls for <b>repentance</b> and a return to peace, humility, and obedience so that they may all the more <i>“partake in God’s promises.”</i> Clearly, Clement does not teach an unconditional security where behavior is irrelevant. Rather, he exhorts to <i>“clothe ourselves in concord, being humble and self-controlled… living in the fear of God”</i> – because only in this way will they remain in God’s favor. In summary, Clement of Rome’s letter shows an expectation that <b>Christians must continue in faithfulness and moral purity</b>, or else they will face <i>“great danger”[<sup>earlychristianwritings.com</sup></i>](https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/1clement-hoole.html#:~:text=14%3A1%20It%20is%20therefore%20meet,are%20leaders%20of%20detestable%20sedition)</i> of judgment.
