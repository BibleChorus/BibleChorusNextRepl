Jumping to the 3rd century, **Cyprian of Carthage** (c. AD 250) was a bishop who shepherded his church through intense persecutions and the subsequent crisis of the *lapsed* – those who denied Christ or compromised under persecution. After the persecution eased, many of the lapsed desired to return to the church. Cyprian’s writings (especially *On the Lapsed* and *On the Unity of the Church*) reveal his view that **apostasy and serious sin put one’s soul in dire peril, and only through sincere, often lengthy repentance could they be restored – if at all**. He battled two extremes: the rigorists (Novatian) who said there is *no* forgiveness for serious post-baptismal sin, and the laxists who would readmit the lapsed too easily. Cyprian steers a middle course of **stern but hopeful penance**.

In <b>On the Lapsed</b>, Cyprian vividly describes how some Christians fell – many sacrificed to idols to save their lives, a grave sin of apostasy. He calls their sin <b>adultery against God</b> and warns that <i>even martyrdom later could barely suffice to atone for it[<sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050701.htm#:~:text=Advent%20www,of%20the%20kingdom%3B%20while)</i>. His tone is urgent: <i>“Let no one cheat himself, let no one deceive himself. The Lord alone can have mercy...</i>* those who have done this (lapsed) must engage in full repentance**.”*[<i><sup>newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=,Revelation%202%3A5)[newadvent.org</i></sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=17,sins%20which%20have%20been%20committed). He condemns those lapsed ones who were <b>“obstinate”</b> after their sin – some, after escaping death, went right back to worldly business without contrition[<i><sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=pleasure%20in%20unrighteousness.,unbelievers%2C%20they%20take%20hold%20of). He says such people <i>“despise the Lord’s precepts, neglect the remedy for their wound, and will not repent… When they ought to prostrate themselves to God, they think they stand fast. They have taken peace for themselves when nobody granted it… seduced by false promises… Thus, while by the rashness of some a <b>false safety</b> is either promised or trusted, the hope of <b>true safety</b> is taken away.”[<sup>newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=pleasure%20in%20unrighteousness.,unbelievers%2C%20they%20take%20hold%20of)[newadvent.org</i></sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=persuasion%20kills%20worse%20than%20persecution,62%20safety%20is%20taken%20away)</i>. This is a remarkable line: some pastors in Cyprian’s time were too lenient, <i>“promising”</i> God’s forgiveness prematurely (perhaps influenced by confessors who gave lapsed people immediate absolution). Cyprian calls that a <i>false safety</i> which robs the sinner of <b>true safety</b> by preventing proper repentance[<i><sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=persuasion%20kills%20worse%20than%20persecution,62%20safety%20is%20taken%20away). In other words, telling someone “Don’t worry, you’re forgiven, all is well” when they haven’t fully repented is actually cruel – it may <b>lock them in a state of damnation</b> by removing urgency to change[<i><sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=persuasion%20kills%20worse%20than%20persecution,62%20safety%20is%20taken%20away). Apply that today: telling a porn-addicted believer, “Hey, we all struggle, grace covers you, you’re fine,” might be giving them <i>false safety</i> and short-circuiting the <i>true safety</i> that would come through radical repentance. Cyprian would rather see the sinner <b>agonize in repentance</b> than be prematurely comforted. He insists the lapsed must <i>“be thoroughly exercised in repentance”</i>, with prayer, fasting, tears – <i>“let not the repentance be less than the sin”</i> he says[<i><sup>newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=of%20a%20Father%20He%20is,out%20nights%20in%20watchings%20and)[newadvent.org</i></sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=us%20greatly%20lament,be%20surrounded%20with%20sackcloth%20and). <i>“Do you think the Lord can be quickly appeased, whom with faithless words you have denied?... You must pray more eagerly and entreat… be clothed in sackcloth… after losing the garment of Christ, you must seek none other… After the devil’s feast, now prefer fasting”[<sup>newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=of%20a%20Father%20He%20is,out%20nights%20in%20watchings%20and)[newadvent.org</i></sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=Lord%20can%20be%20quickly%20appeased%2C,you%20must%20prefer%20fasting%3B%20be)</i>. This dramatic call to penance shows Cyprian’s conviction: a Christian who gravely sins (like apostasy or sexual immorality) <b>risks eternal loss</b>, and their only hope is <b>thorough, humble, prolonged repentance</b>. There’s no cheap grace here.

Cyprian saw two great dangers for those in sin: <b>despair</b> (thinking they can’t be forgiven) and <b>presumption</b> (assuming forgiveness without true conversion). He addresses both: he encourages that God <i>will</i> forgive the truly penitent (he wasn’t a Novatian extremist), but he fiercely rebukes the <i>presumptuous lapsed</i> who demanded instant restoration. In <i>On the Lapsed</i>, chapter 27, he says: <i>“Nor let those persons flatter themselves that they need repent the less, who... defiled their conscience with certificates [of idolatry]. That profession of one who denies is the testimony of a Christian disowning faith… Let him not cease to carry out his repentance and to entreat the Lord’s mercy, <b>lest what seems less in the quality of his fault should be increased by his neglect of atonement</b>.”[<sup>newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L590%2027,testimony%20of%20a%2C%20Christian%20disowning)[newadvent.org</i></sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L634%20and%20let,by%20his%20neglect%20of%20atonement)</i>. This is key: someone might think their sin wasn’t “that bad” – Cyprian says, even if lesser, if you downplay it and skip proper repentance, it becomes <i>worse</i>. A small sin with no repentance can damn as surely as a great sin, because it reveals contempt for God’s holiness.

He goes on: <i>“<b>Do not be moved by that imprudent error of some who neglect the medicine for their wound and will not repent</b>. Thoughtless before their sin was acknowledged, after their sin they are obstinate; neither steadfast before, nor supplicant afterward. When they ought to have stood firm, they fell; when they ought to lie in humility, they think they stand. They have taken peace to themselves when none was given… Their words eat like a cancer; their conversation is like contagion… They who take away repentance for sin, close the way of atonement. Thus it happens that, while by the rashness of some a false safety is either promised or trusted, <b>the hope of true safety is taken away</b>.”[<sup>newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=pleasure%20in%20unrighteousness.,unbelievers%2C%20they%20take%20hold%20of)[newadvent.org</i></sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=34,62%20safety%20is%20taken%20away)</i>. We already cited parts of this, but it bears repeating for emphasis. Cyprian paints a vivid picture of <b>self-satisfied “Christians”</b> who sinned and now refuse to humble themselves. They <i>claim peace</i> without doing the work of repentance. This arrogance – taking grace for granted – is a deadly cancer in the church, he says. Those who preach an easy forgiveness without requiring repentance <i>“close the way of atonement”[<sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=persuasion%20kills%20worse%20than%20persecution,62%20safety%20is%20taken%20away)</i>. In effect, they <b>bar people from actually being forgiven</b>, because forgiveness comes on God’s terms (contrite heart, etc.), not via flippant declarations. What a lesson for today, where many preachers hastily assure audiences of pardon without ever addressing specific sins or calling for heartfelt turning from evil! Cyprian would call that pastoral malpractice that steals souls’ salvation.

Cyprian’s own approach was to impose a period of <i>public penance</i> on the lapsed – they had to demonstrate sorrow over time before readmission. Theologically, he believed <b>no one is beyond God’s mercy</b> if truly penitent (<i>“Let no one ever despair of God’s mercy”</i> he says). But he equally believed <b>no one is saved without repentance</b>. He quotes Scripture such as <i>“Return to Me with all your heart… rend your heart and not your garments”[<sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L642%20whole%20heart%2C,all%20your%20heart%2C%20and%20at)</i> and encourages the lapsed to realize the magnitude of their sin and do works befitting repentance (Joel 2:12–13). Cyprian also echoes Hebrews, warning them not to harden their hearts or rely on <i>“vain stupor”</i>. In chapter 29 he pleads: <i>“Do you in repentance and grief look into your sins; acknowledge the very grave sin of your conscience; open the eyes of your heart to understanding your sin; neither despair of the Lord’s mercy nor yet at once claim His pardon… As we have sinned greatly, so let us greatly lament… let not the repentance be less than the sin.”[<sup>newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=35,wanting%20a%20long%20and%20careful)[newadvent.org</i></sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=misery%2C%20do%20you%20in%20repentance,Think%20you%20that%20the)</i>. He balances: don’t despair (God can forgive), but also don’t claim pardon too fast (you have no right). Fear God as Judge <i>and</i> trust Him as Father, but only after a <i>sincere</i> return.

In sum, <b>Cyprian’s voice is one of fervent warning and earnest pastoral care</b>. He absolutely believed that baptized Christians could <b>lose salvation by serious, willful sin</b> (like apostasy, adultery, etc.), and that some indeed had done so. He called the church to <b>enforce discipline</b> and require evidence of repentance before offering restoration, precisely because souls were at stake. He knew some lapsed would never come back (in fact, he warns that some were demon-possessed or went insane – which he interpreted as divine judgment[<i><sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=not%20repent%20nor%20make%20confession,lapses%20occurring%20in%20the%20world)), but he held out hope for those who <i>humbled themselves</i>. Cyprian has no concept of a “carnal Christian” coasting into heaven. For him, <b>there are penitent Christians on the way to salvation, and impenitent (or false) Christians on the way to damnation</b>. He quotes 1 John 2:4 – those who say they know God but don’t obey are liars[<i><sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=,Revelation%202%3A5). And he exhorts the church to <i>“assist such men with our prayers”</i> that they may be restored, but also to <i>“separate and purge out the offense”</i> (On Lapsed, ch. 15) so that the church remains holy.

Cyprian’s context was unique (persecution), but his principles apply broadly. If he saw our modern situation – multitudes in churches living indistinguishably from the world yet assuming heaven – he would thunder the same rebukes: <i>“Let none deceive themselves. Unless they repent thoroughly, weeping for their sins, they cannot have peace with God. Because some teachers promise them safety in sin, the true hope of salvation is lost!”[<sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=persuasion%20kills%20worse%20than%20persecution,62%20safety%20is%20taken%20away)</i>. That is exactly our concern in this book. The early Church like Cyprian stands with us in affirming: <b>ongoing unrepented sin will lead to perdition, even for the baptized believer</b>. Only repentance and continued holiness lead to eternal life.
