A church that reclaims the **warnings of Scripture** must also loudly proclaim the **hope of the gospel**: that no sinner who turns to Christ in truth will be turned away, and that God’s grace is sufficient not only to forgive but to *transform*. This hope, however, shines brightest against the dark backdrop of judgment. Therefore, we begin by affirming both: **the fate of the unrepentant and the promise to the repentant.** It is a grave truth that anyone indulging in pornography or other willful sins is, at present, on a trajectory toward the lake of fire (Rev. 21:8). It is an equally glorious truth that if that person repents—thoroughly and genuinely—they will find mercy and the power to live a new life.

The Apostle Paul masterfully holds grace and judgment together in his teaching. In <b>Romans 6</b>, after explaining that we are justified by faith and under grace, he anticipates a possible misunderstanding. He asks: <i>“What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin so that grace may increase?”</i> and he answers emphatically, <i>“Far from it! How shall we who died to sin still live in it?”[<sup>biblehub.com</sup></i>](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/romans/6.htm#:~:text=1%20What%20shall%20we%20say,resurrection%2C%20%2010knowing%20this%2C%20that)</i>. Here Paul affirms a crucial doctrinal and experiential reality: those united to Christ have <i>died to sin</i>. This isn’t flowery language—it’s a statement of fact. When we truly came to Christ, something in us fundamentally changed: our old self was crucified with Him <i>“so that we would no longer be slaves to sin.”[<sup>biblehub.com</sup></i>](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/romans/6.htm#:~:text=through%20the%20glory%20of%20the,f%5Dfreed%20from%20sin)</i> If we grasp this truth, it radically changes our perspective. <b>A Christian continuing in known sin is not just doing something naughty; it is a contradiction of their very identity</b>. Paul essentially says, “You can’t live in sin—you died to it. It no longer owns you.” This is both a theological declaration and a moral imperative.

<b>Romans 6</b> proceeds to counsel the believer: <i>“Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its lusts”[<sup>biblehub.com</sup></i>](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/romans/6.htm#:~:text=12%20Therefore%20sin%20is%20not,the%20Law%20but%20under%20grace)</i>. This implies that if we <i>do</i> let sin reign, we are disobeying a direct order and reverting to an authority (sin) that has no right to rule us. Paul warns that presenting ourselves to sin leads to slavery and <b>“resulting in death”[<i><sup>biblehub.com</sup></i>](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/romans/6.htm#:~:text=15%20What%20then%3F%20Are%20we,because%20of%20the%20weakness%20of)</b>, whereas presenting ourselves to obedience leads to righteousness. We see here the stakes: <b>continued obedience to sin results in (eternal) death</b>. There’s no soft-pedaling. But then Paul pivots to hope: <i>“But thanks be to God that though you were slaves of sin, you became obedient from the heart… and having been freed from sin, you became slaves of righteousness.”</i> (Rom. 6:17–18). This is the hopeful reality we must embrace: <b>in Christ, freedom from sin’s dominion is not only an ideal—it is an operative truth</b>. We <i>were</i> slaves; now we are free to obey God. We have a new master, righteousness, which leads to sanctification and “the outcome, eternal life” (Rom. 6:22). The famous verse that concludes the chapter reminds us of both sides: <i>“For the wages of sin is death, but the gracious gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”</i> (Rom. 6:23). Notice, this is addressed to believers, summarizing Paul’s whole argument. If a Christian yields to sin, they earn death (the same fate as an unbeliever), but if they abide in Christ, eternal life is theirs as a gift. <b>Grace does not eliminate wages; it provides a way to escape the wages through union with Christ.</b>

So, dear reader, consider your own life. **Have you been using grace as an excuse to sin?** Perhaps not consciously, but subtly? Romans 6 challenges us: if you think you can carry on with pornography (or any willful sin) because God is gracious, you are twisting grace into a license, which Scripture forbids (Jude 4). The truth is that *grace united you to Christ’s death and resurrection*. If you truly partake of Christ, you have power to renounce that sin. This is both sobering (no excuse for sin) and incredibly hopeful (sin’s power *is* broken in Christ!). It’s a call to *action*: *“consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ”* (Rom. 6:11). That means we actively reckon in our minds: “I do not have to obey this lust. In Christ I am alive to God, and dead to this behavior.” This reckoning is part of repentance—aligning our mindset with God’s truth.

While Romans 6 gives the doctrinal backbone, <b>Titus 2:11–14</b> gives a concise, beautiful picture of grace-enabled living. It says: <i>“For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all people, <b>instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires</b> and to live sensibly, righteously, and in a godly manner in the present age”[<sup>biblegateway.com</sup></i>](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus%202&version=NASB#:~:text=11%C2%A0For%20the%20grace%20of%20God,AA%29eager%20for%20good%20deeds)</i>. Note that grace <i>instructs</i> us—some translations say “trains us” or “teaches us.” Grace is like a teacher schooling us in a new way of life. It doesn’t pat us on the head and say, “There, there, continue as you were.” No, grace takes us firmly in hand and drills us in the disciplines of denying ungodliness. <b>Pornography, lust, dishonesty, drunkenness—these are “worldly desires”</b> that grace commands us to renounce. By the grace of God (and only by His grace) can we say “No” to these passions effectively. The same grace then trains us to live self-controlled (“sensibly”), upright (“righteously”), and godly lives <i>now</i>, even before we reach heaven. This counters the notion some have that we only expect to be free from sin in glory. Paul insists that grace is effective <b>“in the present age”[<i><sup>biblegateway.com</sup></i>](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus%202&version=NASB#:~:text=11%C2%A0For%20the%20grace%20of%20God,AA%29eager%20for%20good%20deeds)</b>. Yes, we still battle sin daily, but we battle <i>from victory</i>, not from utter defeat. We can make real progress; we can experience real purity of heart and mind by God’s grace.

Titus 2:13–14 goes on to root this in Christ’s work: <i>“looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus, who <b>gave Himself for us to redeem us from every lawless deed</b>, and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good deeds.”[<sup>biblegateway.com</sup></i>](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus%202&version=NASB#:~:text=11%C2%A0For%20the%20grace%20of%20God,AA%29eager%20for%20good%20deeds)</i>. Reflect on that: Jesus did not just give Himself to forgive the guilt of our lawless deeds; He died to <b>redeem us from those deeds themselves</b> – to buy us out of bondage to lawlessness. His goal is a purified people, eager to do what is good. <b>If we remain wallowing in lawless deeds (like viewing porn, committing adultery in the heart), we are frustrating the very purpose of Christ’s death.</b> That is serious. But conversely, it means <i>deliverance is fully possible</i> because Christ intended it. He <b>“gave Himself”</b> with our complete sanctification in view. This ought to inject tremendous hope into the struggling sinner: <i>Christ is invested in my purity. He died for this very thing—to break these chains off me.</i> You are not left to your own strength; the Lord has a stake in your freedom from sin.

Thus, grace and judgment are not enemies; they are friends. The warning of judgment (if we persist in sin, we die) should drive us to cling to grace and avail ourselves of its power. And the true grace of God always directs us away from sin, never into it.

At this juncture, then, let us state clearly the twin truths this chapter presses: <b>(1) Anyone practicing sins like pornography, sexual immorality, and the like, without repentance, must expect that if they continue on that path, their destiny will be the lake of fire (the second death).</b> This is in line with Scriptures such as <i>Revelation 21:8</i>, which includes “the sexually immoral” among those whose <i>“part will be in the lake that burns with fire”</i>. No amount of prior religious experience or knowledge will shield one who <b>“practices sin”</b> deliberately. The Bible says <i>“Do not be deceived,”</i> do not think you’re the exception[<i><sup>bible.com</sup></i>](https://www.bible.com/bible/100/1CO.6.9-10.NASB1995#:~:text=Or%20do%20you%20not%20know,inherit%20the%20kingdom%20of%20God). (2) <b>If that same person repents—truly turns from sin to God—they will be saved, cleansed, and kept by God’s power unto salvation.</b> There is absolutely no sin too great for God’s mercy in Christ. As proof, Scripture reminds even egregious sinners who repent: <i>“Such were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified…”[<sup>biblegateway.com</sup></i>](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/1%20Corinthians%206%3A11#:~:text=match%20at%20L364%20And%20such,the%20Spirit%20of%20our%20God)</i>. The church at Corinth had ex-fornicators, ex-adulterers, even ex-idolaters and homosexuals. They <i>were</i> those things, but by repentance and faith they were washed and made new. <b>No one who genuinely repents is beyond hope.</b>

It is the duty of the church to deliver both messages together: *“If you continue in sin, you will perish”* and *“If you repent and trust Christ, you will be forgiven and transformed.”* Let us now turn to what true repentance entails, and how one might pursue it earnestly, drawing on God’s promised help.
