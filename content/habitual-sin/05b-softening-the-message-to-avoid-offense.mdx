Why have these warnings faded? A key factor is that modern church leaders, often unconsciously, <b>soften their message to avoid conflict with prevailing theological comforts in the pews</b>. As evangelical pastor Dave Mann observed, many preachers feel a “subtle... pressure” to <b>“avoid conflict with theological positions held by [members]”</b>, resulting in <b>“softening what the Scriptures say”[<i><sup>alltogether.co.nz</sup></i>](https://alltogether.co.nz/a-secure-salvation-and-modern-church-preaching/#:~:text=Calvinism%20versus%20Arminianism%20is%20an,became%20increasingly%20aware%20of%2C%20and)</b>. In evangelical circles over the last century, one deeply held position is the belief that a Christian’s salvation is absolutely secure once they have believed—no matter what sins might follow. Preachers know that questioning this gives rise to controversy. Thus, even when preaching from challenging texts that originally carried stern warnings, they may tread lightly or explain away the gravity of the passage. Mann confesses that he himself at times <b>“softened some truths”</b> to not “offend others’ theology,” taking the easier path of emphasizing comforting interpretations[<i><sup>alltogether.co.nz</sup></i>](https://alltogether.co.nz/a-secure-salvation-and-modern-church-preaching/#:~:text=Calvinism%20versus%20Arminianism%20is%20an,became%20increasingly%20aware%20of%2C%20and). The theology he alludes to is often a form of <b>guaranteed eternal security</b>. If people in the congregation have been taught “once saved, always saved,” a pastor who implies a believer could forfeit salvation by returning to sin risks pushback. <b>To avoid this, many choose silence or generalities over clarity and warning.</b> The <b>“fear of man…override[s] the fear of God”</b> in shaping sermon content[<i><sup>alltogether.co.nz</sup></i>](https://alltogether.co.nz/a-secure-salvation-and-modern-church-preaching/#:~:text=felt%20we%20preachers%20were%20often,Join%20me%20on%20this%20two). This dynamic leads even earnest pastors to focus on God’s promises but neglect His threats, inadvertently fostering a one-sided message. Over time, churchgoers internalize a gospel of <b>cheap grace</b>—grace that <b>forgives without transformation</b>. The late theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer famously labeled this <i>“the deadly enemy of our church”</i>: <i>“Cheap grace is the preaching of forgiveness without requiring repentance… baptism without church discipline… Communion without confession… grace without discipleship, grace without the cross, grace without Jesus Christ”[<sup>thegospelcoalition.org</sup></i>](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/themelios/article/the-skim-milk-gospel-of-cheap-grace/#:~:text=,%28Part%20I%2C%20Chapter%201)</i>. His critique, though penned in the 1930s, reads like a diagnosis of today’s evangelical culture. In many churches, <b>forgiveness is preached, but practical repentance and holiness are downplayed</b>. Personal sins, especially sexual sins that hide behind closed doors, are handled with kid gloves—if handled at all—lest the grace message be perceived as too “harsh.” But as we will see, <b>this softening is a far cry from the stance of the early church</b>, and even from Scripture itself, which holds grace and godly fear in healthy tension.
