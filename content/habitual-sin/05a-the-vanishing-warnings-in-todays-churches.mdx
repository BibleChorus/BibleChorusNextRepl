In many contemporary churches, one finds an atmosphere of assurance so strong that warnings about sin’s consequences have all but vanished. Even <b>vibrant evangelical congregations</b>, known for energetic worship and doctrinal confession, often shy away from explicitly telling their members that persistent sin can jeopardize their salvation. This reticence is not limited to obviously compromised or liberal churches; it is evident even in assemblies that otherwise seem faithful. The result is a generation of churchgoers who assume all is well with their souls, even as they indulge in habitual sins like pornography, drunkenness, or greed, rarely (if ever) hearing a sermon that such behavior, if unrepented, leads to damnation. One New Zealand pastor, reflecting on his experience in an evangelical church, admitted he felt <b>“uncomfortable with the ‘soft’ message”</b> he heard from a sermon on a harsh biblical passage. He noticed some self-identified believers living “anything but ‘Christian’” lives—yet absolutely confident of their salvation[<i><sup>alltogether.co.nz</sup></i>](https://alltogether.co.nz/a-secure-salvation-and-modern-church-preaching/#:~:text=I%20wrote%20this%20reflection%20to,preaching%20in%20many%20of%20our). His frank assessment was that <b>preachers themselves often give “overly-softened messages” that compromise truth</b>, perhaps out of fear of offending people[<i><sup>alltogether.co.nz</sup></i>](https://alltogether.co.nz/a-secure-salvation-and-modern-church-preaching/#:~:text=I%20wrote%20this%20reflection%20to,preaching%20in%20many%20of%20our). In short, <b>the clear New Testament warnings to Christians have been muted</b>. Many believers have never been told that those who “practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God” (Gal. 5:21), or if they have heard it, they assume it applies only to unbelievers, not to themselves. This represents a striking change from the preaching of the apostles and the early church, who did not hesitate to warn even the baptized that <b>continuing in grievous sin would exclude them from Christ’s kingdom</b>.
