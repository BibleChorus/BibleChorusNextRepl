We turn now to the Apostle **John**, whose first epistle addresses the marks of a true Christian. John’s letter is full of assurances of God’s love and grace, yet it also contains **uncompromising tests of obedience**. Contrary to the false teachers of his day (and ours), John insists that *continuance in sin* is incompatible with being a child of God. Consider these piercing words:

*“No one who abides in Him sins; no one who sins has seen Him or knows Him. Little children, make sure no one deceives you; the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous; the one who practices sin is of the devil… No one who is born of God practices sin, because His seed abides in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. By this the children of God and the children of the devil are obvious: anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor the one who does not love his brother.” (1 John 3:6–10)*

Here again we see the *“make sure no one deceives you”* caution. Evidently, even in the first-century church some were claiming one could *know God* while living in sin. John will have none of it. To *“sin”* in this passage means to **live in ongoing, unrepented sin** (present tense Greek verbs indicate continuous action). John is not saying a Christian never commits an act of sin (indeed, he earlier says *“if we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves”* – 1 John 1:8). Rather, he’s drawing a line between a life characterized by **practicing sin** versus **practicing righteousness**. The difference is stark and “obvious,” as he says. If someone’s life is a continuous pattern of sin – obeying sinful desires as a rule – that person “belongs to the devil,” regardless of what they profess. They *“have not seen or known”* Christ in truth (v.6). Conversely, the one **truly born again** has God’s “seed” (life) in him, which keeps him from surrendering to sin’s power. There will be an overall pattern of righteousness, however imperfectly.

John’s emphasis is that **saving fellowship with God transforms one’s behavior**. Any “Christian” who is *indistinguishable from a child of the devil* in conduct **is in fact a child of the devil**. Strong words! But necessary. John lovingly addresses the readers as “little children,” reinforcing that this truth guards them from deception. It parallels Paul’s *“do not be deceived”* and Hebrews’ warnings. We cannot claim to be justified by Christ if we make peace with what **Christ died to destroy** (the works of the devil, v.8). Earlier in the epistle, John put it succinctly: *“By this we know that we have come to know Him, **if we keep His commandments**. The one who says ‘I have come to know Him’ and does not keep His commandments **is a liar**, and the truth is not in him”* (1 John 2:3–4). Again, the **identity** (knowing God) is verified by the **habit of obedience**. If a person habitually breaks Christ’s commands, their claim to know Him is false – they are lying, perhaps even to themselves.

What commandments does John have in mind? Primarily the commands to **believe in Christ and to love one another** (1 John 3:23). But also all that Christ and His apostles taught, which certainly includes moral purity. John specifically mentions *“the one who does not love his brother”* is not of God (3:10), and he later adds that *“no murderer has eternal life abiding in him”* (3:15) and *“if someone says ‘I love God’ and hates his brother, he is a liar”* (4:20). These are further examples of the principle: **a real relationship with God is incompatible with a life of hatred, murder, or any such darkness**. Similarly, Revelation 21:8 (which we cited earlier) listed “all liars” and the sexually immoral as having their part in the lake of fire – showing that **living in falsehood or immorality is utterly irreconcilable with being saved**.

Returning to **sexual sin in particular** (the focus of our book): Jesus taught that lusting after a woman in one’s heart is akin to adultery (Matt 5:27–28). A Christian man who persists in consuming pornography is thus *practicing adultery in heart* repeatedly. Can a man do this and truly *“abide in Christ”* at the same time? John’s answer would be *no*. If one *“makes a practice”* of sexual immorality, that person cannot simultaneously claim to be *“born of God”*. Paul told the **Thessalonians**, *“this is the will of God, your sanctification; that is, that you **abstain from sexual immorality**”* (1 Thess 4:3). He then warned that *“the Lord is an avenger in all these things... because God has not called us for the purpose of impurity”* (4:6–7). To *continue* willfully in sexual impurity is to defy the very purpose of God’s calling and to put oneself in line for God’s avenging judgment. John would categorize such a one not as a struggling Christian, but as *“not of God”* if there is no repentance. This is not to discourage someone who *is* fighting and repenting daily – rather, it is to **expose the lie** of the person who says, *“I’m a Christian”* but has **settled into** a pattern of porn use, adultery, or any sin without genuine striving for holiness. Scripture says that claim of knowing God is *null and void*.
