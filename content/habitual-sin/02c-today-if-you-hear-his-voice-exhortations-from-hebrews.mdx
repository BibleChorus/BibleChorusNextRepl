Perhaps the **strongest warnings in the New Testament** are found in the Epistle to the **Hebrews**. These were written to professing Christians who were tempted to *“shrink back”* (Heb 10:38) from the costly path of discipleship. The author employs some of the most unsettling language in Scripture to jolt them (and us) to persevere. We will consider two major passages: Hebrews 6 and 10. Keep in mind, these warnings appear *within* a letter that also magnificently teaches Christ’s sufficiency and God’s promises. The presence of these warnings shows that *assurance* and *exhortation* go hand in hand – true believers take heed and thus continue in faith.

**Hebrews 6:4–8** speaks of the dreadful fate of apostasy:

*“For in the case of those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, and then have fallen away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance, since they again crucify to themselves the Son of God and put Him to open shame. For ground that drinks the rain... and yields thorns and thistles, it is worthless and close to being cursed, and it ends up being burned.” (Heb 6:4–8)*

This passage describes people who clearly were within the community of believers – <i>enlightened</i> (baptized and taught), <i>tasted</i> the heavenly gift and the Spirit’s grace, even experiencing the goodness of God’s Word. And yet, shockingly, they later <b>“fall away”</b> (the Greek term <i>parapipto</i>, meaning to commit apostasy). The text soberly states that <b>renewal to repentance becomes impossible</b> for such, because by their willful departure they effectively <b>re-crucify Christ</b> – treating Him with contempt despite having known His grace. This is not describing a momentary lapse or struggle, but a decisive repudiation of Christ’s lordship (whether by explicit renunciation or by hardened, continual disobedience). The <b>imagery of land and rain</b> then drives it home: a field that ought to produce vegetation but instead yields only thorns is about to be cursed and burned[<i><sup>reformedbooksonline.com](https://reformedbooksonline.com/on-the-continuation-of-justification/#:~:text=25,%E2%80%A6)[reformedbooksonline.com</i></sup>](https://reformedbooksonline.com/on-the-continuation-of-justification/#:~:text=27,%E2%80%9D). This clearly alludes to <b>final judgment</b> by fire. In other words, those who <b>turn back decisively from Christ</b> after receiving His truth have no second remedy – they are like barren land destined for burning. While interpretations vary, the <b>plain sense</b> is that a person can come <i>very far</i> in association with Christ – even receive the Spirit’s influences – and yet, by <i>falling away</i>, end up damned with no further opportunity to repent. This utterly demolishes the notion that <i>“once saved, always saved”</i> as a <b>guarantee regardless of behavior</b>. True believers must take this as a <b>warning to persevere</b> and not even flirt with the thought of forsaking Christ for sin.

Equally severe is **Hebrews 10:26–31**, which warns against deliberate, ongoing sin after knowing the gospel:

*“For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a terrifying expectation of judgment and the fury of a fire which will consume the adversaries. Anyone who has set aside the Law of Moses dies without mercy... How much severer punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace? ...‘The Lord will judge His people.’ It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God.” (Hebrews 10:26–31)*

Here the author includes himself with the word “**we**” – *“if we go on sinning willfully…”* – showing this is a real warning to the community of professing believers. To “sin willfully” in context means to **knowingly persist in sin** (any sin, but especially the sin of repudiating Christ), as opposed to stumbling out of weakness. The consequence is dire: *“no sacrifice for sins remains.”* If one spurns Christ’s sacrifice through persistent disobedience, there is **no further remedy** from God – only judgment. By using Old Testament law as a lesser example (where apostates were executed), he argues that **rejecting Christ’s covenant** is even worse, meriting a *“much severer punishment.”* Notice the apostate is described as one who **was sanctified by Christ’s blood** (at least in outward covenant terms) yet later calls that blood “unclean” – as if treating Jesus’ sacrifice as worthless. This person **insults the Spirit of grace** – the very Spirit who testifies to Christ. All this language points to someone who *started as a Christian*, then willfully abandoned holiness and faith. The conclusion leaves us trembling: *God will judge His people* – yes, *His own people* – if they forsake His Son. *“It is a terrifying thing to fall into [His] hands.”*

We must not blunt this edge: **a Christian who “goes on sinning willfully” is on the path to fiery judgment**. Some try to limit Hebrews 10:26 to the “sin” of reverting to Judaism. But verse 26 does not so limit it – *“sinning willfully”* is broad. In truth, any **willful continuation in known sin** is a form of trampling Christ underfoot. When one stubbornly refuses to repent, he treats Christ’s blood lightly, as if it neither cleanses nor deserves his allegiance. Such a person is effectively saying, *“Jesus died for me, but I don’t regard His lordship or holiness – I’ll keep my beloved sin.”* This is an **insult to the Spirit of grace**. The Scripture leaves no room for comfort here: if that pattern persists, **no sacrifice covers those sins**. The only destiny is “fury of fire.” How many in our churches today **“go on sinning willfully”** – whether it be viewing pornography regularly, cheating in business, nursing bitterness, or any number of habitual sins – all the while assuming grace will cover it? The Word of God says otherwise: such persons should expect *judgment, not mercy*, unless they repent. These are not our words but God’s. It is *loving* to press this truth on any who are toying with damnation through cherished sin.

Hebrews also echoes earlier the warning from Psalm 95: *“Today if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts”* (Heb 3:7). The writer exhorts believers to *“encourage one another day after day… so that none of you will be **hardened by the deceitfulness of sin**”* (Heb 3:13). Sin is **treacherous** – it lies to us, gradually hardening our conscience until repentance becomes humanly impossible. Thus, even apart from final apostasy, there is the very real danger of a **Christian’s heart growing hard** and unbelieving, leading them to fall away: *“Take care, brethren, that there not be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart **that falls away from the living God**”* (Heb 3:12). Notice he addresses them as “brethren” yet warns of departing from God – showing again that the threat is real, not hypothetical. The only safeguard is to respond to God **today**, in the moment of conviction – not to delay repentance. One who continually **hardens himself** may cross a line where he cannot soften again. The example given is the Israelites who perished in the wilderness: *“And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest, but to those who were **disobedient**? So we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief”* (Heb 3:18–19). Disobedience and unbelief are two sides of the same coin. If we persist in disobedience, we show an evil heart of unbelief and may forfeit the eternal “rest” promised to God’s people.
