# Chapter 3C: Early Church Witness - 3rd-4th Century Voices

As Christianity moved into the 3rd and 4th centuries, the church faced new challenges. Periods of intense persecution tested believers' faith, while seasons of imperial favor brought the temptation of nominal Christianity. Yet throughout these dramatic changes, the church's leading voices maintained the same sobering message we heard from their predecessors: **Christians who persist in serious sin face eternal condemnation unless they genuinely repent**.

In this chapter, we will examine three towering figures of this era: **Cyprian of Carthage** (3rd century), who dealt with the crisis of the *lapsed* during persecution; **John Chrysostom** (4th century), the "golden-mouthed" preacher who warned against spiritual complacency; and **Augustine of Hippo** (4th-5th century), whose pastoral writings balanced divine sovereignty with human responsibility. Despite their different contexts and theological emphases, these fathers unanimously taught that **salvation requires perseverance in holiness** and that those who make peace with sin forfeit their hope of eternal life.

## Cyprian of Carthage – The Lapsed, Presumption, and the Need for Penitence

**Cyprian of Carthage** (c. AD 250) was a bishop who shepherded his church through intense persecutions and the subsequent crisis of the *lapsed* – those who denied Christ or compromised under persecution. Cyprian's writings reveal his view that **apostasy and serious sin put one's soul in dire peril, and only through sincere, often lengthy repentance could they be restored – if at all**. He battled two extremes: the rigorists who said there is *no* forgiveness for serious post-baptismal sin, and the laxists who would readmit the lapsed too easily.

In **On the Lapsed**, Cyprian calls their sin **adultery against God** and warns that *even martyrdom later could barely suffice to atone for it*<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="ref-1">[1]</a></sup>. His tone is urgent: *"Let no one cheat himself, let no one deceive himself. The Lord alone can have mercy... those who have done this (lapsed) must engage in full repentance."*<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="ref-2">[2]</a></sup>

He says such people *"despise the Lord's precepts, neglect the remedy for their wound, and will not repent... When they ought to prostrate themselves to God, they think they stand fast... Thus, while by the rashness of some a **false safety** is either promised or trusted, the hope of **true safety** is taken away."*<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="ref-3">[3]</a></sup> Cyprian calls premature pastoral assurance a *false safety* which robs the sinner of **true safety** by preventing proper repentance<sup><a href="#footnote-4" id="ref-4">[4]</a></sup>. Telling someone "Don't worry, you're forgiven" when they haven't fully repented may **lock them in a state of damnation** by removing urgency to change.

Apply that today: telling a porn-addicted believer, "Hey, we all struggle, grace covers you," might be giving them *false safety* and short-circuiting the *true safety* that would come through radical repentance. Cyprian would rather see the sinner **agonize in repentance** than be prematurely comforted. He insists the lapsed must *"be thoroughly exercised in repentance"*, with prayer, fasting, tears – *"let not the repentance be less than the sin"*<sup><a href="#footnote-5" id="ref-5">[5]</a></sup>.

## John Chrysostom – "Unless You Continue, You Will Be Cut Off"

**John Chrysostom** (AD 347–407), archbishop of Constantinople, fought against complacency by emphasizing **the conditional nature of God's promises**: God is good, but we must *cooperate* and continue in faith and virtue.

In his **Homily on Romans 11**, commenting on Paul's metaphor of the olive tree, Chrysostom drives home the warning:

"Behold the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in His goodness; otherwise you also shall be cut off." (<BibleVerse reference="Romans 11:22" />) — "The blessings do not abide by you unmovable if you turn listless... for thou also, unless thou continue in the faith, will be cut off."<sup><a href="#footnote-6" id="ref-6">[6]</a></sup>

Chrysostom emphasizes Paul's **"if"**: God's kindness toward believers is contingent on their continuing. He explicitly refutes any idea that "once grafted, always grafted": *"The blessings do not abide if you grow careless."* If a Christian becomes spiritually "listless" (lazy, complacent), he can indeed be **cut off** just as the Jews were.

He states plainly: **"There is need of something more than faith... if you do things worthy of God's love."**<sup><a href="#footnote-7" id="ref-7">[7]</a></sup> In context he means a mere start in faith is not enough; one must *"continue in His goodness"*, i.e., *live in a way worthy of God's grace*. This aligns with James and 1 John that **active obedience must accompany faith**.

## Augustine of Hippo – Enduring to the End and Admonishing the Flock

**Augustine** (AD 354–430) taught both God's sovereignty and human responsibility. He often preached to warn **against false security**. In his *Homilies on 1 John*, Augustine says:

"Let no man say, 'I am born of God, and so I shall not sin,' ... "In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God." (<BibleVerse reference="1 John 3:10" />) ... If you live unrighteously, you seek to be numbered among the children of the devil."<sup><a href="#footnote-8" id="ref-8">[8]</a></sup>

Augustine tells his congregation essentially, *Don't claim to be a child of God if you are living in unrighteousness – such a life shows you belong to the devil.* **The necessity of living righteously is non-negotiable for Augustine**. He declares: *"No murderer has eternal life abiding in him"* (quoting <BibleVerse reference="1 John 3:15" />) – so if a Christian were to commit murder or hate his brother, he cannot say he has eternal life unless he repents.

In one letter, Augustine laments some loose priests who did not enforce discipline, saying they *"kill those whom they falsely assure of life"*<sup><a href="#footnote-9" id="ref-9">[9]</a></sup>. He writes, *"The unrighteous will not possess the kingdom of God"* (<BibleVerse reference="1 Corinthians 6:9" />). *"Take heed what you promise; make sure of whom you promise. **Certainly, to promise the kingdom to the unrighteous is to kill them outright**."* Thus Augustine too decries **false assurances** given to those in deadly sin.

## Conclusion: The Continuing Witness of the Later Early Church

From this survey of the 3rd and 4th centuries, we see the **same unwavering message**: **baptized Christians must persevere in holiness, and those who persist in serious sin face eternal damnation unless they sincerely repent**. Cyprian fought against both despair and presumption, warning against "false safety" that robs sinners of true salvation. Chrysostom preached that believers can be "cut off" if they grow spiritually listless. Augustine insisted that those living in unrighteousness "seek to be numbered among the children of the devil."

The church fathers unanimously taught that **ongoing unrepented sin leads to perdition, even for the baptized believer**. They explicitly rejected the notion that Christians could live like the world while remaining assured of salvation. Instead, they called for urgent, thorough repentance and warned that presumption on God's grace could itself become a damning sin.

Their unified voice challenges every modern notion of "cheap grace" or spiritual complacency. Their message to someone trapped in habitual sin would be clear and urgent: *"You are in mortal danger. Do not be deceived by those who promise peace while you live in rebellion. Repent thoroughly, turn completely from your sin, and prove your repentance by a transformed life."*

In our next chapter, we will see how this same biblical emphasis on the necessity of persevering holiness was carried forward by the **Puritan theologians** of the 16th and 17th centuries, who faced their own battles against spiritual presumption.
