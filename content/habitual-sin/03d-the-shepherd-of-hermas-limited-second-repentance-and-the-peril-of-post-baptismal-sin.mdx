One of the most illuminating early texts on this subject is **The Shepherd of Hermas** (mid-2nd century). *Hermas* is an allegorical work recording visions and teachings given to a man named Hermas. Its central concern is the **moral purity of Christians and the possibility of repentance after sin**. Hermas reflects the struggle of the early church to balance God’s mercy with the seriousness of sin *after baptism*. At times, Hermas was so strict that later Christians debated its meaning. But one passage stands out for its **urgency about not delaying repentance**:

*“The Lord has sworn by His glory, in regard to His elect, that if any one of them sin after a certain day which has been fixed, he shall not be saved. For the repentance of the righteous has limits. Filled up are the days of repentance to all the saints; but to the heathen, repentance will be possible even to the last day.”[<sup>newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/02011.htm#:~:text=day%2C%20if%20they%20repent%20with,promises%20with%20great%20%2044)[newadvent.org*</sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/02011.htm#:~:text=elect%2C%20that%20if%20any%20one,to%20direct%20their%20ways%20in)*

This is an astonishing statement. Hermas claims a revelation that God set a <i>deadline</i> for His people to repent. Essentially, he’s saying: <i>God gave the Church a limited time window (“a certain day”) by which the elect needed to turn from sins; beyond that, any who continue sinning will not be saved.</i> He explicitly says <i>“the repentance of the righteous has limits,”</i> and that for Christians (<i>“saints”</i>) the allotted days of repentance have been completed[<i><sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/02011.htm#:~:text=day%2C%20if%20they%20repent%20with,promises%20with%20great%20%2044). In contrast, non-Christians (“heathen”) still have until the final judgment to find repentance (presumably through conversion).

Scholars interpret this in context of a crisis in the early church: many believers had fallen into grave sins (like denying Christ under persecution, or sexual immorality), and the church wrestled with whether to readmit them if they repent. Hermas seems to indicate that <b>God in His mercy allowed one single post-baptismal repentance</b> – a sort of extraordinary grace period – but warns that believers must not presume they can sin with impunity repeatedly. <i>“If any one of them sins after [that fixed day], he shall not be saved.”[<sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/02011.htm#:~:text=day%2C%20if%20they%20repent%20with,promises%20with%20great%20%2044)</i> This suggests that <b>continued willful sin can exhaust one’s opportunity to repent</b>. Hermas pictures a scenario where <b>grace’s door can shut</b> on a Christian who keeps abusing it. The theology here is admittedly peculiar (later Church would allow that sincere repentance is always possible if one lives). But the thrust is clear: <b>Don’t delay repentance, and don’t assume you can always come back later.</b> There may come a time when <b>repentance is no longer granted</b> to the hardhearted. This aligns with Hebrews 6: <i>“it is impossible to renew them again to repentance”</i> if they fall away.

Hermas repeatedly urges righteousness. In Vision 3, he sees a tower being built (symbolizing the Church), and some stones are rejected due to sins; he’s told they can be purified if they repent quickly, but if not, they may not enter the tower. At one point, Hermas asks if certain grievous sins of believers can be forgiven, and the angel (the Shepherd) essentially says *yes, if done once; but continual betrayal of God is deadly.* The Shepherd says: *“You have sinned greatly, yet not for your own sake only was this allowed, but that you might admonish others not to do wickedly... But if, after this, you sin and are not converted... you shall be punished.”* Hermas thus advocates **one time of post-conversion repentance** – after that, one who **returns to sin is in peril of damnation**.

Even if one doesn’t accept Hermas’ idea of a fixed deadline in a literal sense, the <b>pastoral warning is profound</b>: <i>The righteous cannot assume indefinite time to repent.</i> God may withdraw the grace of repentance if we persistently spurn it. Therefore, Hermas urges believers to <b>stop procrastinating and purify their lives immediately</b>. He vividly describes believers who <i>“add to their sins and walk in lusts”</i> as “defiling the name of the Lord” – those individuals, he warns, will <b>lose salvation if they do not cease[<i><sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/02011.htm#:~:text=day%2C%20if%20they%20repent%20with,promises%20with%20great%20%2044)</b>. This is entirely in line with our thesis: Christians who <i>continue</i> in deliberate sin will not be saved. Hermas would say – they might not even get the chance to say “sorry” at the end, because their hearts will be too hardened or the allowance for their repentance may have passed.

For example, in one parable Hermas describes some virgins (symbolizing virtues) who will abandon a man if he strays, and won’t return unless he really repents; if he waits too long, they won’t return at all. It’s an allegory of how virtues (and by extension, salvation) can be lost by negligence. In another section, Hermas is told: *“Only those who fear God and keep His commandments have life with God; but as for those who do not keep His commandments, there is no life in them.”* That straightforwardly equates **obedience with life**; disobedience with spiritual death – again echoing Scripture.

Overall, <i>The Shepherd of Hermas</i> delivered a wake-up call to an early 2nd-century church that may have grown slack: <b>God is holy, and He requires holiness from His people. If they fall into serious sin, they have a narrow window to repent and purify themselves; otherwise, they will perish.</b> This reflects the intense seriousness with which the early church viewed <i>post-baptismal sin</i>. It was not shrugged off under “grace” – it was seen as a <i>threat to one’s salvation</i> unless remedied by genuine, often tearful, repentance. Hermas even has the angel say he asked God to allow <i>this one time</i> of repentance for the lapsed, indicating it was an exceptional mercy. The text explicitly rejects the idea that one can keep oscillating between sin and repentance endlessly. In modern terms, Hermas would absolutely reject the notion of a habitual porn-user casually saying, <i>“Well, I’ll repent later; God will always take me back.”</i> Hermas would thunder: <i>“The repentance of the righteous has limits!”[<sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/02011.htm#:~:text=day%2C%20if%20they%20repent%20with,promises%20with%20great%20%2044)</i>. There may <i>come a point</i> where later never comes. So again: <b>Repent now and utterly, or risk being lost.</b>
