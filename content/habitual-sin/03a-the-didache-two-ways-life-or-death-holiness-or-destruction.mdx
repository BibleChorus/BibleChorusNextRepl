One of the earliest Christian documents after the New Testament is the **Didache** (late 1st century, also called “The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles”). It served as a sort of church manual for early Christian communities. The Didache opens with a memorable description of **two ways**: the way of life and the way of death. It leaves no doubt that **sinful conduct leads to damnation, whereas obedience leads to life**:

*“There are two ways, one of life and one of death; but a great difference between the two ways… The way of life … is this: First, you shall love God who made you; second, love your neighbor as yourself… And the second commandment of the Teaching; You shall not commit murder, you shall not commit adultery... you shall not commit fornication, you shall not steal... you shall not practice magic, you shall not practice witchcraft... you shall not covet...\* My child, flee from every evil thing, and from every likeness of it…”\*\*[<sup>newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0714.htm#:~:text=And%20the%20second%20commandment%20of,tongued%3B%20for)[newadvent.org*</sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0714.htm#:~:text=empty%2C%20but%20fulfilled%20by%20deed,more%20than%20your%20own%20life)*

After enumerating many sins to avoid (including sexual sins, occult practices, and attitudes like double-mindedness and pride), the Didache then describes:

*“ The way of death is this: First of all it is evil and full of curse: murders, adulteries, lusts, fornications, thefts, idolatries... deceit, haughtiness... [those who do these things are] utter sinners. Be delivered, children, from all these.”\*\*[<sup>newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0714.htm#:~:text=And%20the%20way%20of%20death,pitying%20a%20poor%20man%2C%20not)[newadvent.org*</sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0714.htm#:~:text=labouring%20for%20the%20afflicted%2C%20not,delivered%2C%20children%2C%20from%20all%20these)*

The stark contrast is evident. The <i>“way of life”</i> involves <b>obeying God’s commandments</b>, practicing love and purity. The <i>“way of death”</i> is characterized by the very sins listed. And the readers (“children”) are urged to <b>keep free</b> from all those vices. The Didache doesn’t explicitly use the terms <i>heaven</i> and <i>hell</i> here, but <i>“way of death”</i> clearly implies <b>final destruction</b>. If one walks in those sins, one is on the road to <b>death</b> (spiritual death and exclusion from life). The implication is that <b>baptized Christians must continue living by the way of life</b>. In fact, later the Didache instructs that before baptism, the catechumens must learn all these commands and commit to following <i>“the yoke of the Lord”</i> (Didache 6). It even says, <i>“If you are able to bear the entire yoke of the Lord, you will be perfect; but if you are not able, do what you can”[<sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0714.htm#:~:text=Chapter%206,and%20Food%20Offered%20to%20Idols)</i> – indicating that strenuous obedience is expected, even if one grows into full maturity over time.

What’s crucial is that the earliest post-New Testament writing presents the Christian life in **binary terms**: either you pursue the path of holiness (leading to eternal life), or you follow sin (leading to death). There is no third category of “carnal Christian who will still slide into heaven.” If some modern teachers imply that one can live like those on the “way of death” yet still have eternal life because of a one-time decision, the **Didache’s authors would vehemently disagree**. They inherited from the apostles the understanding that **continuance in gross sin is a soul-destroying path**. *“Be delivered... from all these,”* they plead. We see no hint that they would console a person living in adultery or lust with *“Don’t worry, you prayed the sinner’s prayer.”* Rather, they would say, *“Flee from those sins or you will perish on the way of death!”* The Didache shows the **pastoral balancing act**: it’s straightforward about moral demands, yet also merciful (e.g., it urges gentleness and patience with those who can only partially bear the load). But never does it **minimize the gravity of sin** or suggest that an immoral Christian is safe.
