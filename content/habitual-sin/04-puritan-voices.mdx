# Chapter 4: Puritan Voices

*Richard Baxter, John Owen, Thomas Watson, John Flavel: conditional justification and the necessity of mortification.*

## Coming Soon

This chapter will examine the powerful voices of Puritan theologians who preached the necessity of holiness and the mortification of sin. We will explore the writings of:

- **Richard Baxter** (1615-1691) - On conditional justification and practical godliness
- **John Owen** (1616-1683) - "The Mortification of Sin in Believers" and the necessity of killing sin
- **Thomas Watson** (1620-1686) - The doctrine of repentance and holy living
- **John Flavel** (1627-1691) - Keeping the heart and spiritual watchfulness

These Puritan divines understood that:
- True faith necessarily produces holiness
- Believers must actively mortify (kill) sin in their lives
- There is no salvation without sanctification
- Self-examination is crucial for assurance

Their writings will demonstrate that the message of this book – that habitual sin endangers the soul – was central to Reformed and Puritan theology.

*"If you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live."* (<BibleVerse reference="Romans 8:13" />)
