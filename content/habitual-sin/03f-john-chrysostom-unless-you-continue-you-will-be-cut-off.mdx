Moving into the 4th century, we consider **John Chrysostom** (AD 347–407), renowned archbishop of Constantinople. Chrysostom, known as the “golden-mouthed” preacher, left a wealth of homilies on Scripture. In them, he frequently exhorts moral living and perseverance. He lived in a Christianized empire, where many assumed themselves Christian by baptism. Chrysostom fought against complacency by emphasizing **the conditional nature of God’s promises**: God is good, but we must *cooperate* and continue in faith and virtue. We’ll highlight a few pertinent insights from his homilies.

In his **Homily on Romans 11**, commenting on Paul’s metaphor of the olive tree (where Gentile believers are grafted in and Jews were cut off for unbelief), Chrysostom drives home the warning to believers:

*“Behold the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in His goodness; otherwise you also shall be cut off.” (Romans 11:22) — “The blessings do not abide by you unmovable if you turn listless... for thou also, unless thou continue in the faith, will be cut off.”\*[<sup>newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210219.htm#:~:text=And%20he%20does%20not%20say%2C,faith%2C%20will%20be%20cut%20off)[newadvent.org*</sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210219.htm#:~:text=fear%20%3A%20since%20the%20Lord,79%2C%20will%20be%20cut%20off)*

Chrysostom emphasizes Paul’s <b>“if”</b>: God’s kindness toward the Gentile believers is contingent on their continuing. He explicitly refutes any idea that “once grafted, always grafted”: <i>“The blessings do not abide if you grow careless.”</i> If a Christian becomes spiritually “listless” (lazy, complacent), he can indeed be <b>cut off</b> just as the Jews were. Chrysostom even explains, <i>“none of these things is immutable, neither your good nor [the Jews’] evil… he [Paul] humbles the one and encourages the other… He warns the Gentile: ‘you will be cut off if you grow listless.’”[<sup>newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210219.htm#:~:text=For%20it%20was%20not%20God,was%2C%20that%20you%20might%20continue)[newadvent.org</i></sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210219.htm#:~:text=to%20the%20Jew%20to%20be,But%20it%20is%20very)</i>. This is a clear affirmation that a believer’s current standing can change – a sobering possibility. The phrase <i>“neither your good nor his evil is immutable”[<sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210219.htm#:~:text=so%20%28Sav,was%2C%20that%20you%20might%20continue)</i> means: a righteous person can fall, and an evil person can repent – so no one should boast or despair, but take heed. Chrysostom thus upholds human free will in persevering. He states plainly: <b>“There is need of something more than faith… if you do things worthy of God’s love. For there is need of something more than faith.”[<i><sup>newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210219.htm#:~:text=thou%20be%20faint%20at%20hearing,by%20the%20Jews%2C%20and%20what)[newadvent.org</i></sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210219.htm#:~:text=in%20,For%20thou%20also%2C%20he%20says)</b>. Some might misconstrue that, but in context he means a mere start in faith is not enough; one must <i>“continue in His goodness”</i>, i.e., <i>live in a way worthy of God’s grace[<sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210219.htm#:~:text=thou%20be%20faint%20at%20hearing,by%20the%20Jews%2C%20and%20what)</i>. This lines up with James, 1 John, etc., that <b>active obedience must accompany faith</b>.

Chrysostom elsewhere addresses Christian behavior pointedly. In one homily (Homily 3 on Ephesians), he says it’s possible for a believer to *“believe rightly but live evilly, and that person will be punished more severely”* because he disgraces his faith. He is very concerned with **moral conduct as proof of faith**. He often warns against drunkenness, sexual immorality, and the like among churchgoers. In a Homily on Hebrews, he notes how *fearful* the warnings are, and says God uses them to keep us diligent. He interprets Hebrews 10:26–27 straightforwardly: *“A **believer who sins wilfully has no forgiveness but awaits fiery judgment**.”* (Homily 18 on Hebrews). He did believe restoration was possible through repentance (as did all orthodox Fathers), but he emphasized the danger of a hardened state.

One of Chrysostom’s best-known sayings comes from his treatise **On the Priesthood**: he says pastors must be watchful, for *“If **one soul perishes through your negligence, you shall render an account**”* (On Priesthood, Book 6). He took Ezekiel’s watchman concept to heart. That’s partly why he preached so bluntly: to ensure **no one in his care would think sin is trivial**.

His famous motto regarding personal holiness is often quoted: <i>“<b>Be always killing sin, or sin will be killing you</b>.”</i> (Though often attributed to Owen, a similar sentiment is found in Chrysostom’s writings on Romans 8:13 in spirit). Essentially, Chrysostom taught that the Christian life is a constant battle, and if you yield to sin, it brings death even to you who have believed. In fact, the <b>Philip Schaff edition of Chrysostom</b> notes: <i>“He asserts, against the Novatians, that it is possible to put away the guilt of sins <b>committed after baptism, by ceasing from the practice of them and working that which is good[<sup>ccel.org</sup>](https://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf113.iii.iv.xv.html#:~:text=asserts%2C%20as%20against%20the%20Novatians%2C,always%20through%20God%E2%80%99s%20mercy%20and)</b>.”[<sup>ccel.org</sup></i>](https://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf113.iii.iv.xv.html#:~:text=asserts%2C%20as%20against%20the%20Novatians%2C,always%20through%20God%E2%80%99s%20mercy%20and)</i>. That description (from a footnote about his Homily on Ephesians) suggests Chrysostom believed post-baptism sins can be forgiven <i>if</i> one genuinely stops and replaces them with good – basically, repentance and renewed obedience. But that also implies if one does <b>not</b> cease from them, the guilt remains. So Chrysostom would tell a porn-addicted Christian: <i>“Yes, you can be forgiven and cleansed – but you <b>must</b> stop the sin and begin to practice righteousness. Otherwise, you remain guilty and risk the fate of the unbelieving.”</i>

We already saw how he explicated Romans 11:22 with that *“otherwise you too shall be cut off.”* Another powerful line from him: *“Fear can maintain our salvation by causing us not to be high-minded… For if He spared not the natural branches (the Jews), neither will He spare you. This implies that if God spared not those who had long been with Him, **much less will He spare you if you sin**.”* (Homily on Romans 19). He’s explicitly teaching that **sin in a believer will bring judgment**; being “with God” historically (like Israel) didn’t save them when they rebelled, and likewise being a Christian now won’t save *us* if we rebel.

Chrysostom, like other Greek Fathers, believed in synergy: God’s grace initiates, but man must cooperate. He did not teach a Calvinistic irreversible election; he believed a Christian could **fall from grace by their own negligence**. In Homily 13 on Hebrews, he says: *“We are come to share in Christ, **if** we hold fast our confidence firm to the end (Heb 3:14).”* He stresses the word *“if,”* saying it shows *“not all will share, only those who hold their faith firmly to the end.”* He then warns of the evil heart of unbelief that can arise, as Hebrews 3:12 states, causing one to depart from God. He saw it as the duty of believers to *keep their hearts with vigilance*.

In summary, John Chrysostom’s voice continues the early tradition: <b>Christians must persevere in faith and holiness, or they can be cut off and lost.</b> He consistently uses scriptural warnings to admonish his flock to <i>“continue in His goodness”[<sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210219.htm#:~:text=And%20he%20does%20not%20say%2C,faith%2C%20will%20be%20cut%20off)</i>. There is zero hint of “once saved always saved” in his preaching – quite the contrary, he frequently reminds comfortable churchgoers that they might end up worse than unbelievers if they take grace lightly. He once said, <i>“It would be better for us if we were defeated and humbled, than that we should be victorious and puffed up; for <b>victory makes us careless, but fear renders us solicitous</b>.”</i> (Homily on Matthew 5). He knew the value of a holy fear to keep us from carelessness. That echoes the New Testament: <i>“Do not be arrogant, but fear”</i> (Rom 11:20) – precisely the line he expounded.
