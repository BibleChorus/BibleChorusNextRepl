The early church not only preached repentance, they **practiced it communally**. New converts in the early centuries often underwent catechesis where they would explicitly **renounce the devil and all his works** before baptism. Tertullian (3rd century) describes how candidates said, “I renounce you, Satan, and your pomps and your angels.” This formal renunciation was a way of solidifying the break with the old life. It might be beneficial for modern believers to similarly articulate their renunciations. For instance, a man repenting of pornography might pray or declare in writing: “I renounce the spirit of lust and the idol of sexual pleasure. I renounce every lie that has kept me bound (like ‘I deserve this’ or ‘I can’t help it’). I renounce Satan’s claim on my mind through these images. I belong to Jesus Christ—mind, body, and soul.” Such declarations have no magic, but they help the believer mentally and spiritually draw a line in the sand. They can be spoken aloud in private prayer or with a pastor present for accountability. The point is to engage the will and mouth in **choosing allegiance to Christ over sin.**

Early Christians also had a process for restoring those who fell into major sins after baptism. In many cases, they imposed a period of penance—acts of contrition, exclusion from communion for a time, and then a formal reconciliation service. While some aspects of that became overly rigid in later church history, the underlying principle is sound: serious sin requires serious repentance, and **the church community should be involved in restoring the sinner gently** (Gal. 6:1). In Protestant circles we may not have a sacrament of penance, but we should still have a pathway for restoration that follows church discipline and might include counseling, increased accountability, steps to rebuild trust, etc. 

Another early practice was **corporate confession in worship.** Even today, many liturgical churches include a prayer of confession and assurance of pardon each Sunday. Evangelical churches could benefit from that. It normalizes repentance as part of ongoing Christian life. It reminds everyone that though saved by grace, we still need to examine ourselves and confess frequently. A sample might be: *“Most merciful God, we confess that we have sinned against You in thought, word, and deed… We are truly sorry and we humbly repent. For the sake of Your Son Jesus Christ, have mercy on us and forgive us; that we may delight in Your will, and walk in Your ways, to the glory of Your Name. Amen.”* Many might find such prayers foreign or rote, but if done sincerely, they can be powerful. They also unite the congregation in humility. Specifically for someone struggling, hearing the whole church confess sin can break the feeling of isolation or shame—they realize, *we all are in need of grace continually.*

The early church also strongly emphasized **prayer and sometimes fasting** when dealing with stubborn sins or spiritual oppression. Jesus said some demonic kind (which could be behind addictive sins) only come out by prayer and fasting (Mark 9:29). Thus, incorporating fasting into one’s repentance journey can be beneficial. Fasting humbles the soul, intensifies prayer, and can break fleshly dominance. A repentant person might fast one day a week as they seek breakthrough, or do a multi-day fast with pastoral guidance. Again, not as a work to earn forgiveness, but as a means to discipline the body and seek God’s power (1 Cor. 9:27). The early church fasted regularly (often Wednesdays and Fridays) as part of piety. Modern believers have largely lost this, but it's being rediscovered as a potent practice.

Lastly, early Christians had a keen sense of living in the **Holy Spirit’s power**. After repentance, often there was prayer for filling of the Spirit or even deliverance ministry if needed. It would be prudent in the church today to lay hands on those coming out of enslaving sin and pray for the Holy Spirit to fill them afresh. We need divine power to truly change. In the book of Acts, believers prayed and were filled with boldness and grace to overcome challenges (Acts 4:31). So in our churches, when someone confesses and repents, let’s surround them and ask God to fill them mightily with His Spirit, to seal their decision and empower holy living.

In sum, the early church gives us a pattern of **serious community support and structure for repentance**. We should not view repentance as a merely private affair; it’s a team project in the Body of Christ. When one member suffers (in sin), the others rally to help restore them (1 Cor. 12:26). If you, reader, are repenting, do not hesitate to lean on your brothers and sisters. Let them be God’s hands and voice to you. Yes, it’s ultimately between you and God, but God often works through His people. As James says, *“pray for one another that you may be healed”* (James 5:16) – there is healing in that mutual prayer.

Now, to provide tangible guidance, the next section offers a suggested liturgy or pattern of repentance that can be used either individually or in a small group/church setting. Following that, we include reflection questions to help you dig deeper into your own heart and situation, fostering lasting change.
