As we continue to flesh out repentance, let’s revisit **Titus 2:11–14** to understand how God’s grace actually works in training us for holiness. Many have a truncated view of grace, seeing it only as unmerited favor that forgives. But in Titus we see grace as an active teacher. The Greek term for “instructing” has the connotation of disciplining or child-training. Grace, in a sense, **“disciples” us with both encouragement and correction**.

Imagine grace personified as a wise mentor in your life. When you repent and yield to God, grace comes alongside to show you the new way. Grace says, “No, my child, don’t go to those websites or dwell on those images—that’s not who you are now. Yes, it will hurt a bit to deny yourself, but I will comfort you with better joys.” Grace also says, “Here, feed on the Word of God; let’s replace those old thoughts with God’s promises and commands. Let’s set a new routine: when you feel tempted, pray or call a brother in Christ.” Grace says, “Get up, morning by morning, and present yourself to God anew—I will supply the strength.” In other words, **grace empowers the practical disciplines that keep us from falling back.** This might include daily prayer, Scripture meditation, involvement in a supportive Christian community, and even things like fasting to subdue the flesh. All these are not “works” to earn salvation; they are *means of grace* to train us in godliness.

One might ask, how do I rely on grace and not slip into self-effort? The key difference is in the heart’s posture. If I engage in repentance and subsequent discipline with an attitude of *“I will fix myself by my effort,”* that is self-reliance. If instead my attitude is *“Lord, I’m obeying and putting to death the deeds of the body **by the Spirit** (Rom. 8:13), trusting You to enable and change me,”* that is relying on grace. Externally the actions might look similar (cutting off avenues to sin, praying regularly, etc.), but internally one is fueled by pride or fear and the other by faith and love.

Titus 2:12 specifically notes grace trains us to deny “ungodliness.” Ungodliness is a general term for irreverence or living without regard for God. When someone views pornography, in that moment they are living *as if God did not see or matter*. It’s profoundly ungodly. Grace teaches us to live *consciously before God’s face* in everything (“Coram Deo” as the Reformers said). A huge part of repentance is learning to cultivate the **fear of the Lord** — not a slavish terror that He’ll smite us arbitrarily, but a reverent awareness that *“God is here, I cannot sin in His presence without grieving Him.”* Grace, oddly enough, produces this fear. As Titus said, Jesus “gave Himself to redeem us” — when we contemplate the cross, where grace poured out, we actually feel a greater horror of sin (because that’s what made the cross necessary) and a greater love for righteousness (because that’s what Jesus died to secure). So if you want to fuel repentance, **meditate on the cross of Christ**. See His agony for your lust, your lies, your pride. Let it break your heart and simultaneously heal it. This is the discipline of grace: it softens our heart so that obedience is drawn out by love, not merely driven by duty.

Another aspect Titus highlights is **“looking for the blessed hope… the glory of Christ”** (2:13). Grace keeps our eyes on the future – the return of Jesus and our eternal life with Him. Why is this important for repentance? Because sin often offers immediate gratification at the expense of future joy. Pornography, for example, gives a quick illicit thrill but steals the capacity for genuine intimacy and ultimately jeopardizes eternal joy. Grace reminds us of the *“surpassing value of knowing Christ”* (Phil. 3:8) and the coming glory. It reorients our reward system: we learn to say, “I forego the cheap pleasure now because I am waiting for a far greater pleasure – the smile of my Savior, a pure heart, the inheritance of the saints.” Moses exemplified this, as Hebrews 11:25–26 says, *“choosing rather to endure ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin, considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; **for he was looking to the reward**.”* We need that eternal perspective. It is notable how seldom eternity is mentioned in many churches today except at funerals. We must become *eternity-minded* again, because it is a powerful motivator to holiness. Living in light of the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10-11) is healthy for the soul—Paul said *“Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men”*, including persuading men to repent and live righteously.

Grace also instills <b>zeal</b>. Jesus redeemed a people <i>“zealous for good deeds”[<sup>biblegateway.com</sup></i>](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus%202&version=NASB#:~:text=11%C2%A0For%20the%20grace%20of%20God,AA%29eager%20for%20good%20deeds)</i>. A truly repentant person doesn’t just stop doing bad; they become eager to do good. This is a sign of heart change: you move from apathy or reluctance about spiritual things to a zeal—maybe even what others call fanaticism—for holiness, evangelism, serving others, etc. It is vital to replace the mental and time-space that sin occupied with positive pursuits. For instance, if someone spent hours every week on pornography, those hours need reallocation—perhaps to ministry, to physical exercise, to learning a skill, to volunteering, to prayer meetings. Idleness is often the devil’s playground. Grace teaches us to fill our lives with fruitful labor in the Lord such that the appeal of sin diminishes. <b>An idle Christian is a vulnerable Christian</b>. The Victorian preacher Charles Spurgeon once said, “If you are idle in Christ’s work, you are active in the devil’s work.” Strong words, but they ring true.

Let’s put this plainly for someone struggling: **if you repent, God’s grace will not leave you alone to muddle through.** The Holy Spirit, the Spirit of grace, will actively work in you. You will find new desires awakening—perhaps a hunger for Scripture like never before, or an urge to make restitution for past wrongs, or a compassion for others in sin. Follow those impulses of the Spirit. They are part of His training. Conversely, if you attempt to repent but neglect the means of grace (prayer, Word, fellowship), you effectively cut yourself off from the fuel needed to sustain repentance. It’s like trying to run a marathon without eating. Many a Christian has “burned out” trying to fight sin in isolation from God; eventually the willpower fails. Don’t let that happen—**stay plugged into grace’s power through communion with God**.

To summarize, Titus shows grace as the initiator and sustainer of a holy life. We renounce ungodliness *by grace*, we live uprightly *by grace*, looking to Jesus’s return *by grace*, and do good works *by grace*. This should keep us both humble (we can’t boast in our repentance as if we did it) and confident (we’re not in this battle alone; Almighty God is at work in us mightily).
