Even as we revel in the hope of repentance, it is necessary to keep the **alternative outcome** crystal clear: continuing in willful sin will absolutely lead to damnation. This is the **terrifying reality** that should shock the sinner out of complacency. Sometimes, after repeated failures, a person starts to think, “Maybe God will just have to take me as I am; I can’t change.” That thought must be confronted with the sobering truth: *“No, if I refuse to change (repent), I will be lost.”*

The **“lake of fire”** (Rev. 20:15, 21:8) is not an outdated scare tactic; it is a biblical revelation of the final destiny of the unredeemed. Jesus spoke of it as “Gehenna” or outer darkness, a place of weeping and gnashing of teeth. He taught that at the end of the age, He will separate the wicked from the righteous, and the wicked will go *“into the eternal fire”* (Matt. 25:41). Importantly, Jesus did not exclude professing believers from this warning. In fact, some of his most dire warnings were given to disciples. He said, *“Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, [the Father] takes away… such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned”* (John 15:2,6). This demolishes the notion that being “in Him” at one time guarantees eternal immunity. A branch must continue to bear fruit (evidence of living faith) or else be cut off.

For those dabbling in sin, Scriptures like these must be taken to heart. **We must personalize the warning**: “If *I* live after the flesh, *I* will die” (Rom. 8:13). It is not judging others to apply it to oneself. Paul included himself in *“if we deny Him, He will deny us”* (2 Tim. 2:12). Let’s not imagine we are above falling. *“Let anyone who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall”* (1 Cor. 10:12).

One might object: “But I still believe in Jesus, I haven’t denied the faith; I’m just struggling.” The uncomfortable truth is that **actions can deny Christ even if words claim Him.** Titus 1:16 speaks of some who *“profess to know God, but by their deeds they deny Him.”* If we persistently disobey, we are functionally denying His lordship. And Jesus said He will deny those who deny Him. So the person engrossed in habitual, unrepentant sin is, in effect, renouncing Christ’s rule, regardless of what creeds they affirm.

The **final judgment** will not be based on mere claims but on reality. Jesus said many will say to Him “Lord, Lord” and recount religious acts they did, yet He will respond, *“I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness”* (Matt. 7:23). Notice the reason: their life was one of lawlessness (i.e., unrepented sin). This shows that *practicing lawlessness* is incompatible with knowing Christ. If one continues in lawlessness (which includes sexual immorality, among other things), it won’t matter that they once “accepted Christ” or attended church. The question will be: **Did you turn from your lawlessness?** If not, the verdict is “depart from Me.”

It is a fearful thing to imagine hearing those words from the Savior whom you perhaps thought was your friend. Contemplating that moment—standing before the blazing holiness of Jesus with all secrets laid bare—can be a great motivator for change. The early saints used to meditate on the Four Last Things (death, judgment, heaven, hell) as a spiritual discipline to cultivate sobriety and wisdom. We would do well to reclaim some of that. Not morbidly or constantly, but enough to shake us out of temptation’s trance. Next time you feel lured to click that obscene link or cheat in that business deal or nurse that grudge, **pause and picture the Judgment Day.** Imagine the books opened (Rev. 20:12) which have recorded every deed and even every secret thought (Eccl. 12:14). What will that sin look like in the light of God’s throne? Picture also the faces of the saints, shining like the sun (Matt. 13:43), and ask: do I want to throw away a share in *that* glory for this fleeting sin now? Picture, too, the horror on the faces of those being sent away into outer darkness, realizing too late that no excuse stands in that court. These thoughts are not pleasant, but they are salutary medicine for a sin-sick soul.

The point here is not to keep true believers in constant fear that they might accidentally slip into hell. The point is to instill a <b>healthy, saving fear that awakens the lukewarm and hypocritical</b>. If a person is in willful sin, they <i>should</i> be afraid. That fear can lead them to wisdom (Prov. 9:10). <b>If they heed the warning, they will not face the reality</b>. God’s threats, like His promises, are meant to achieve moral ends. When He says “the immoral will not inherit the kingdom” (1 Cor. 6:9–10), it serves the purpose of jolting the immoral person to repentance so that, ironically, they <i>can</i> inherit the kingdom after all (because they became washed and sanctified)[<i><sup>biblegateway.com</sup></i>](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/1%20Corinthians%206%3A11#:~:text=match%20at%20L364%20And%20such,the%20Spirit%20of%20our%20God). If we dilute the threat, we rob it of this effect.

Therefore, as an act of love, let me state plainly: *Dear friend, if you are practicing pornography, adultery, habitual deceit, hatred, or any such willful sin, you are on the road to damnation. Please do not console yourself with thoughts of past religious moments or God’s love in general.* The Scripture says, *“Because of these things [sins] the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience”* (Eph. 5:6). Do not be a son of disobedience. Right now, perhaps, God’s wrath *abides on you* (John 3:36) even as you read this, if you have refused to repent. That wrath is not yet poured out only because of God’s patience, which is meant to lead you to repentance (Rom. 2:4). Do not “think lightly” of that kindness by continuing in sin, because you will store up wrath for yourself (Rom. 2:5). Rather, let the **fear of the Lord** now prompt you to run to the **mercy of the Lord**.

Here is the paradox of the gospel: the ones who *refuse* to fear will eventually face the thing feared; the ones who *do* fear (and thus repent) will find that in Christ their fears are relieved. As the psalmist says, *“His mercy is on those who fear Him”* (Luke 1:50). The God who warns us is also the God who welcomes us when we heed the warning. So let’s transition now from the warning to the welcome: what does thorough repentance look like, and how can we be sure of God’s help and acceptance in it?
