Central to this modern diminishment of warning is the popular doctrine commonly phrased as **“once saved, always saved.”** This teaching, prevalent in Baptist and many non-denominational circles, insists that once a person has truly accepted Christ, they can never finally lose salvation. A more theologically nuanced version in Reformed circles is the **“perseverance of the saints”** – the idea that all whom God has truly saved will persevere in faith and holiness to the end by His power. In theory, perseverance doctrine encourages holy living, teaching that the elect *will* continue in good works. **In practice, however, many believers interpret “perseverance” as a guarantee of heaven regardless of subsequent behavior**, effectively merging it with “once saved, always saved.” Over time, the nuance is lost and only the reassurance remains.

We need only look at official statements of faith to see how this theology is communicated. For example, the Southern Baptist Convention’s <i>Baptist Faith and Message</i> (2000), widely respected and influential, teaches that <b>“All true believers endure to the end”</b> and that those accepted in Christ <b>“will never fall away from the state of grace, but shall persevere to the end.”</b> It concedes that believers may fall into sin and face temporal judgments, <b>“yet they shall be kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation.”[<i><sup>bfm.sbc.net</sup></i>](https://bfm.sbc.net/bfm2000/#:~:text=All%20true%20believers%20endure%20to,God%20through%20faith%20unto%20salvation)</b>. The intent of this statement is to magnify God’s keeping power—and indeed, God is faithful. <b>But the unintended effect on the average church member can be complacency</b>. Many read <i>“will never fall away”</i> as an assurance that <b>no sin or failure on their part could possibly separate them from salvation</b>.

Tragically, some prominent evangelical teachers have gone even further, making blanket statements that virtually <i>eliminate</i> any fear of judgment for the professed believer. <b>Charles Stanley</b>, a widely respected Baptist pastor, asserted in his book <i>Eternal Security: Can You Be Sure?</i> that <i>“Even if a believer… becomes an unbeliever, his salvation is not in jeopardy.”</i> He taught that a Christian could <i>“sin like the devil”</i> and yet <b>“you won’t lose your salvation.”[<i><sup>bible.lockman.org</sup></i>](https://bible.lockman.org/htm_php-c.php?do=show_node&b=67&c=0&v=0&show_ti=2966&show_ts=1&show_user_id=ca7a55acd81d7f5cdd0c6cff2c0bc96e&show_question_id=17377#:~:text=,Security%2C%20Can%20You%20Be%20Sure)</b>. According to such teaching, <b>even renouncing the faith or indulging in the worst sins cannot undo one’s salvation</b>. While not all evangelical leaders go to that extreme, these statements have been circulated to millions through books and broadcasts, shaping the outlook of laypeople. It is easy to see how, under such teaching, <b>any warning after conversion seems unnecessary or at least not urgent</b>. If <i>nothing</i> can annul a saved person’s status as a child of God—if, as Stanley claims, even a born-again person who later becomes an atheist is still saved[<i><sup>bible.lockman.org</sup></i>](https://bible.lockman.org/htm_php-c.php?do=show_node&b=67&c=0&v=0&show_ti=2966&show_ts=1&show_user_id=ca7a55acd81d7f5cdd0c6cff2c0bc96e&show_question_id=17377#:~:text=,3%2C%20MH190)—then the logical conclusion for many is that <b>sin may harm their fellowship with God, but not their ultimate destiny</b>.

Even among Calvinist teachers who stress holiness, one often hears the reassurance that those truly saved will *inevitably* repent before dying. Thus, warnings of perdition for sin are framed as “means God uses to keep us on track” rather than real possibilities for the regenerate. The result? The average church member, lacking theological subtlety, simply hears: **“Real Christians can’t lose salvation, and I’m a real Christian because I professed faith—so I should be fine.”** This mindset can neutralize the effect of biblical warnings. A sermon on sexual purity might be delivered, and a listener hooked on pornography may feel a twinge of guilt. But if he has been taught that grace means **his salvation stays intact in spite of ongoing sin**, he quickly reassures himself that perhaps he’ll lose some rewards in heaven, but surely not heaven itself. In this way, **the doctrine of unconditional security can function, in the pew, as a shield against conviction**. Rather than spurring the believer to examine himself and fear the Lord, it can breed an unhealthy self-assurance.

It is important to note that historically, this idea of absolute security was <b>not the consensus of the church prior to the Reformation</b>. In fact, <b>no Christian teaching before the 16th century claimed that a true believer could never lose salvation</b>. As one historical survey notes, <i>“It was not until the time of John Calvin that anyone would claim that it was impossible for a true Christian to lose his salvation.”</i> All prior generations would have condemned “once saved, always saved” as <b>“dangerous heresy.”[<i><sup>catholic.com</sup></i>](https://www.catholic.com/tract/mortal-sin#:~:text=It%20was%20not%20until%20the,them%20into%20thinking%20that%20their)</b> Even the magisterial Reformers like Luther did not teach it outright. Over the centuries, the doctrine evolved and, in some evangelical circles, <b>degenerated into an extreme form</b>: <i>“some would claim that a Christian could commit grave sins and remain saved: sin did not injure his relationship with God at all.”[<sup>catholic.com</sup></i>](https://www.catholic.com/tract/mortal-sin#:~:text=In%20time%20the%20%E2%80%9Conce%20saved%2C,relationship%20with%20God%20at%20all)</i>. While mainstream Evangelical pastors would deny encouraging sin, the practical outcome of their preaching sometimes comes perilously close to this <b>antinomian attitude</b>. By <b>emphasizing comfort and minimizing exhortation</b>, they risk giving sinning believers false comfort. We will examine specific examples of how respected modern sources handle (or fail to handle) the issue of sin after conversion.
