To deepen the impact of what you’ve read and to help you apply it personally, take time to meditate on and answer the following questions. You might journal your responses or discuss them with a trusted friend or mentor. Be honest before God, for He knows the truth already and loves you still.

1. <b>Regarding Warnings:</b> When you read the warnings in Scripture about certain people not inheriting the Kingdom (e.g., 1 Cor. 6:9–10, Gal. 5:19–21), what is your immediate reaction? Do you tend to gloss over them, assume they don’t apply to you, or do they instill a healthy fear? How might God be using these warnings to get your attention about specific behaviors in your life?[<i><sup>bible.com</sup></i>](https://www.bible.com/bible/100/1CO.6.9-10.NASB1995#:~:text=Or%20do%20you%20not%20know,inherit%20the%20kingdom%20of%20God)
1. <b>Heart Check on Sin:</b> Think about the sin or sins that you struggle with repeatedly. What lies have you believed that keep you returning to them? For example, “I can’t live without it,” or “Just this last time,” or “God will forgive me anyway.” Write down these lies and then write down the truths from God’s Word that refute them. (For instance, <i>“I can do all things through Him who strengthens me”</i> (Phil. 4:13) counters “I can’t change.”) Are you willing to renounce each lie and embrace God’s truth?[<i><sup>alltogether.co.nz](https://alltogether.co.nz/a-secure-salvation-and-modern-church-preaching/#:~:text=I%20wrote%20this%20reflection%20to,preaching%20in%20many%20of%20our)[alltogether.co.nz</i></sup>](https://alltogether.co.nz/a-secure-salvation-and-modern-church-preaching/#:~:text=Calvinism%20versus%20Arminianism%20is%20an,became%20increasingly%20aware%20of%2C%20and)
1. <b>Genuine Repentance Test:</b> Evaluate your past attempts at repentance. Did you fully forsake the sin, or leave some door open? Did you rely on God, or mostly on yourself? Did you continue in new obedience, or eventually drift back? Identify what was lacking—be it depth of surrender, accountability, avoidance of temptation, etc. What concrete steps will you take now to ensure your repentance is thorough and lasting? (E.g., disposing of hidden stashes, installing accountability software, setting up regular mentor meetings, etc.)[<i><sup>biblehub.com](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/romans/6.htm#:~:text=12%20Therefore%20sin%20is%20not,the%20Law%20but%20under%20grace)[bible.lockman.org</i></sup>](https://bible.lockman.org/htm_php-c.php?do=show_node&b=67&c=0&v=0&show_ti=2966&show_ts=1&show_user_id=ca7a55acd81d7f5cdd0c6cff2c0bc96e&show_question_id=17377#:~:text=,Security%2C%20Can%20You%20Be%20Sure)
1. <b>Grace Utilization:</b> In what ways are you actively depending on God’s grace daily? Do you have a routine of prayer and Bible reading that fortifies you against sin? If not, design a simple plan (when, where, how long you’ll pray/read). Consider also: are you availing yourself of the fellowship of believers (or avoiding it out of shame)? How can the community help you, and are you willing to reach out for help? Who will you ask to be an accountability partner or prayer partner in this journey?[<i><sup>biblegateway.com</sup></i>](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus%202&version=NASB#:~:text=11%C2%A0For%20the%20grace%20of%20God,AA%29eager%20for%20good%20deeds)
1. <b>The Cost of Not Repenting:</b> Spend a few moments visualizing the trajectory of your life if you do <i>not</i> repent. What might happen to your relationships, your soul, your eternity? (For example: “If I don’t stop this affair, my marriage will likely end and I’ll wound my children, and I’ll stand before God having broken my covenant.”) Sometimes seeing the potential devastation in advance can strengthen your resolve to avoid it. How does this compare to the trajectory <i>with</i> repentance (e.g., restored relationships, clear conscience, eternal life)?[<i><sup>catholic.com](https://www.catholic.com/tract/mortal-sin#:~:text=It%20was%20not%20until%20the,them%20into%20thinking%20that%20their)[afa.net</i></sup>](https://www.afa.net/the-stand/family/2020/07/porn-and-the-church/#:~:text=%2A%2057,has%20adversely%20impacted%20the%20church)
1. **Restitution and Apology:** Is there anyone to whom you need to apologize or seek forgiveness as part of your repentance? Perhaps a spouse, child, colleague, or friend hurt by your actions? Plan how and when you will do this. Also, is there any restitution needed (returning something stolen, correcting a falsehood, paying a debt)? Make arrangements to set things right, as far as it depends on you. This can be difficult, but it bears powerful witness to the change in you and helps close the door to past wrongs.
1. <b>Endurance Plan:</b> Repentance is the start; how will you <b>endure</b> in your new walk? Anticipate future hurdles: How will you respond when tempted a month from now? A year from now? Write a “battle plan” for temptation: e.g., “If I feel weak or tempted, I will immediately pray and call X for support. I will remember such-and-such Scripture. I will remove myself from the situation.” Also, identify any patterns (HALT – hungry, angry, lonely, tired – that trigger you). How will you address those underlying states in healthy ways?[<i><sup>biblehub.com</sup></i>](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/romans/6.htm#:~:text=15%20What%20then%3F%20Are%20we,because%20of%20the%20weakness%20of)
1. **Joy of Salvation:** Reflect on the joy and relief that God’s forgiveness brings. Do you truly believe you are forgiven? If struggling with guilt, read Psalm 32 and Psalm 51. How does David move from misery to joy? Can you embrace that God really does wash you whiter than snow? **Praise Him** for His mercy until your heart warms and you sense the joy of salvation returning. How can you cultivate that joy daily (perhaps through worship music, thanksgiving prayers, serving others)? The joy of the Lord will be your strength (Neh. 8:10) in staying the course.
1. **Holiness as Love:** Consider the positive side of holiness. It’s not just about avoiding hell, but about loving God wholeheartedly and being filled with His love. In what ways will turning from sin enable you to love God and neighbor more? Perhaps your mind will be freer to focus on others, your energy not drained by shame, your relationships healed to show love. List a couple of hopeful outcomes of your repentance (e.g., “I’ll be able to worship without hypocrisy,” “My marriage can grow in trust,” “I can mentor my children with integrity,” etc.). Keep these in front of you as motivators. Holiness leads to abundant life, not loss.
1. **Accountability Check-In:** If you have an accountability partner or group, when will you check in with them, and what will you report? Plan regular intervals (daily texts, weekly meetings, etc.). If you don’t have such a system, pray about who you could invite into that role. The questions in this section can even be something you discuss with them. Maintaining openness is key to not sliding back into isolation and secrecy.

Use these questions periodically (say, once a week for the first few months, then monthly) to gauge where you are in the journey. Journaling the answers over time will let you see progress and also flag areas where you might be slipping.

**Final Encouragement:** Remember that the Christian life is one of **daily repentance and faith**. Martin Luther wrote in the first of his 95 Theses that “our Lord and Master Jesus Christ willed the entire life of believers to be one of repentance.” This simply means we live with a tender heart, quick to turn back to God whenever we stumble. It’s not meant as a life of constant morbid sorrow, but rather constant willingness to course-correct and grow. As you practice repentance, it will become a source of refreshment. *“Times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord”* (Acts 3:19) when we repent. You will find that each victory over sin, by His grace, brings greater peace and freedom. Your conscience, once burdened, will lighten. You’ll taste the sweetness of walking in the Spirit, ungrieving and unquenched.

And should you fall, do not throw in the towel. Run back to these steps. <b>Repent quickly</b>; do not stay in the mud. The Prodigal Son could have wallowed longer with the pigs, but he arose at once. <i>“A broken and contrite heart O God, You will not despise.”[<sup>thegospelcoalition.org</sup></i>](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/themelios/article/the-skim-milk-gospel-of-cheap-grace/#:~:text=,%28Part%20I%2C%20Chapter%201)</i> That promise stands. God never despises the truly contrite. He is like the father scanning the road for his returning child.

Ultimately, know that your salvation is found in <b>Jesus Christ alone</b>. Keep your eyes on Him—your Savior, Advocate, Good Shepherd, and coming King. He is able to keep you from stumbling and present you blameless[<i><sup>biblegateway.com</sup></i>](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/1%20Corinthians%206%3A11#:~:text=match%20at%20L364%20And%20such,the%20Spirit%20of%20our%20God). The call to holiness is high, but His grace is higher still. The call to repentance is urgent, but His help is near. And the joy set before us is indescribable: to hear on that Day, <i>“Well done, good and faithful servant… Enter into the joy of your Master.”</i> That joy begins even now as we walk in the light with Him.

Take heart, beloved. **Those who sow in tears will reap with songs of joy** (Ps. 126:5). The tears of repentance will water the soil of your heart, and in time, the fruits of righteousness will spring up—fruits that will last into eternity.

*“Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you entirely; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is He who calls you, and He also will bring it to pass.” (1 Thessalonians 5:23–24)[<sup>bfm.sbc.net](https://bfm.sbc.net/bfm2000/#:~:text=All%20true%20believers%20endure%20to,God%20through%20faith%20unto%20salvation)[catholic.com</sup>](https://www.catholic.com/tract/mortal-sin#:~:text=Justin%20Martyr) Amen.*
