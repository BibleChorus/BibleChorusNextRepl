How did the earliest Christians – those closest in time to the apostles – understand the relationship between *baptism, post-conversion sin, and salvation*? Did they teach *“once saved, always saved”* regardless of one’s lifestyle? Did they minimize the threat of **apostasy** (falling away) for believers? The historical record is clear: the early church overwhelmingly believed that **after baptism, a believer must continue in holiness, and that serious sin could indeed put one’s salvation in jeopardy**. They stressed **vigilance and repentance**, warning that those who **turn back to a life of sin face damnation** unless they repent. In this chapter, we will survey a range of early Christian writings from the **1st through 4th centuries** – including *the Didache*, *The Shepherd of Hermas*, *Clement of Rome*, *Ignatius of Antioch*, *Cyprian of Carthage*, *John Chrysostom*, and *Augustine of Hippo*. Despite differences in era and context, we will see a common theme: these early Christian teachers echo the New Testament in insisting that **nominal Christians living in sin will not be saved**. Some even speak of a point of *no return* for those who willfully persist in sin. This historical witness should challenge the modern church to recover a **healthy fear of God** and an emphasis on *perseverance in righteousness*.

Before we begin, it is worth noting that the early church faced real scenarios of baptized believers committing grave sins (like idolatry, sexual immorality, or denying the faith under persecution). Their responses are **pastorally rich**: they upheld God’s mercy for the truly penitent, yet they by no means offered *unconditional security* to the unrepentant. They took Jesus’ and the apostles’ warnings at face value. In doing so, they refuted both the **legalism** of never allowing restoration (as some extreme sects did) and the **antinomianism** of cheap grace. Let us listen to these voices in roughly chronological order.
