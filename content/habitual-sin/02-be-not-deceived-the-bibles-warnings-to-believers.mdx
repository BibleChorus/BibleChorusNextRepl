Scripture confronts us with **unmistakable warnings** that a lifestyle of willful sin is incompatible with salvation. Far from offering carnal Christians a free pass, the Word of God repeatedly declares that **those who persist in disobedience will be excluded from God’s kingdom**. In this chapter, we will briefly examine key biblical passages – without intricate commentary – allowing the force of the text to speak plainly. These verses span multiple authors and testaments, yet they form a consistent witness: *only those who **continue in faith and holiness** will finally be saved.* The **flip side** is equally clear: those who *claim* to belong to Christ yet *“practice sin”* will face eternal death unless they repent. As we compile these scriptures (all quotes are from the NASB for clarity), remember that many of them were originally addressed *to Christians*. The apostles did not hesitate to warn believers about the danger of being deceived regarding sin. Let the reader approach these verses with a humble, open heart – perhaps as if hearing them for the first time – and allow the Holy Spirit to apply them personally.
