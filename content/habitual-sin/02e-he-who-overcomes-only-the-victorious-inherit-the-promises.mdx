A final thread in Scripture’s warning tapestry is the repeated call to **overcome or persevere**. In the Book of **Revelation**, Jesus dictates letters to seven churches (Revelation chapters 2–3). Each letter contains promises *“to him who overcomes.”* For example:

*“He who overcomes, and he who keeps My deeds **until the end**, to him I will give authority over the nations” (Rev 2:26).*

*“Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life… He who overcomes will not be hurt by the second death.” (Rev 2:10–11).*

*“He who overcomes will thus be clothed in white garments; and I will not erase his name from the book of life” (Rev 3:5).*

*“He who overcomes, I will grant to him to sit down with Me on My throne, as I also overcame” (Rev 3:21).*

In the <b>final chapter of Scripture</b>, Jesus says: <i>“He who overcomes will inherit these things, and I will be his God and he will be My son. <b>But for the cowardly and unbelieving and… all liars, their part will be in the lake that burns with fire</b>”</i> (Rev 21:7–8)[<i><sup>nasb.literalword.com</sup></i>](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=Revelation+21%3A8%2C+Revelation+22%3A12-16#:~:text=8%20But%20for%20the%20cowardly,%E2%80%9D). We see here a <b>divide</b>: the overcomers versus the faithless. To overcome means to hold fast to Christ by faith, evidenced in faithfulness and repentance, even amidst trials or temptations. It does <i>not</i> mean sinless perfection, but it does mean <i>persevering resistance</i> to the world, flesh, and devil by Christ’s power. Jesus implicitly defines overcoming in Rev 2:26 as <i>“keeping My deeds until the end.”</i> Note that: the overcomer is one who <i>obeys Christ’s works to the end</i>.

Thus, all the blessed promises of eternal life, divine sonship, ruling with Christ, etc., are reserved **for those who endure and overcome**. Conversely, those who **shrink back, give up, or live in cowardly unbelief** will *not* inherit, but face the second death (Rev 21:8). This is perfectly consistent with everything we’ve seen. *“By your endurance you will gain your lives,”* Jesus taught (Luke 21:19). And *“the one who endures to the end, he will be saved”* (Matt 24:13). These statements were given to disciples in contexts of persecution, but they apply broadly: **only a faith that endures to the finish is true faith**. A “faith” that gets choked out by lust or worldliness and does not *finish* the race will not save (cf. the parable of the soils, Luke 8:13–14). Paul likened the Christian life to a boxing match or a race, saying *“I discipline my body and make it my slave, so that, after I have preached to others, **I myself will not be disqualified**”* (1 Cor 9:27). Even the apostle recognized that *he* had to persevere in holiness, lest he be disqualified (rejected) in the end. How much more should we take heed!

Before moving on, let us dispel a misunderstanding: **None of these scriptures teach salvation by our own works or merits**. Rather, they teach the **necessity of holiness as the fruit of genuine faith**. Believers are saved by grace through faith in Christ, *“not as a result of works”* (Eph 2:8–9). *But* the next verse says *“we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus **for good works**, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them”* (Eph 2:10). A true convert will have a life marked by those good works. If those works are utterly absent – if instead one’s “walk” is characterized by the **works of the flesh** – it indicates the person has not been savingly united to Christ. Thus, the warnings serve to shake false professors out of their deception and to spur true believers onward in fear and trembling. Far from contradicting grace, these exhortations **are grace** – God’s means to keep us clinging to Christ. When Paul told the Romans *“if you live according to the flesh you must die,”* he immediately added *“but if by the Spirit you are putting to death the deeds of the body, you will live”* (Rom 8:13). In other words, **God’s Spirit empowers the Christian to *kill sin*** – and *that* is the path of life. Indeed, *“if we walk by the Spirit, we will not carry out the desire of the flesh”* (Gal 5:16). The true believer **has access to power** to overcome. The false believer complacently *“lives according to the flesh,”* perhaps citing *“grace”* while doing so, and thus proves he doesn’t have the Spirit (Rom 8:9) – unless he repents and seeks God’s mercy for transformation.

Let us summarize the biblical testimony in plain terms: <b>Professing Christians who practice sexual immorality (such as viewing pornography habitually), drunkenness, hatred, deceit, or any other willful sin, are on course for damnation, not salvation.</b> They <b>must not comfort themselves with false assurances</b>. The Word of God commands such people to <i>repent</i> or perish. As Paul succinctly said, <i>“If we deny Him, He will also deny us”[<sup>goodreads.com</sup></i>](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/963394-mortification-of-sin-in-believers-the-necessity-nature-and-means-of-it#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDo%20you%20mortify%3B%20do%20you,%E2%80%9D)</i>. And <i>“Do not be deceived… no sexually immoral persons… will inherit the Kingdom of God”[<sup>nasb.literalword.com</sup></i>](https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=Revelation+21%3A8%2C+Revelation+22%3A12-16#:~:text=8%20But%20for%20the%20cowardly,%E2%80%9D)</i>. On the positive side, <b>if we confess and forsake our sins, trusting in Christ, He is ready to forgive and cleanse us</b> (1 John 1:9). There is abundant pardon for the penitent. But the pardon is never given <i>to those who determine to cling to their sin</i>. Jesus asked, <i>“Why do you call Me ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?”</i> (Luke 6:46). That haunting question should compel each of us to examine ourselves. If you call Jesus “Lord” but continue to <i>serve lust and self</i>, you are deceiving yourself. You cannot have both Christ and your sin. <i>“You cannot serve two masters”</i> (Matt 6:24). <b>Choose this day whom you will serve.</b> The next chapters will show that this exact message – that only those who persist in obedience will be saved, and that Christians living in gross sin will face hell – has been the consistent teaching of faithful Christians throughout history.

Before proceeding, hear one more plea from Scripture itself, one that beautifully balances warning and hope:

*“Pursue peace with all men, and the holiness without which no one will see the Lord. See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God… that there be no immoral or godless person like Esau, who sold his own birthright for a single meal. For you know that even afterwards, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought for it with tears.” (Hebrews 12:14–17)*

Holiness is absolutely necessary to see the Lord – there are no exceptions. And the window of repentance can close if one sells Christ for a moment of sin and later tries to reclaim the blessing. Do not be like Esau. If you have been **trading away your heavenly birthright** for the bitter pleasure of pornography (or any sin), *stop now and weep for your soul*. Seek the Lord while He may be found. *Today* is the day of salvation. The *grace of God* is mighty to forgive and renew – but **it is only found on the path of repentance**. Turn, forsake your sin, and run to Christ in obedient faith. Otherwise, the fury of fire waits to consume the adversaries. These are not our words; they are God’s. We implore you to heed them.
