*(The following is a structured time of prayer, Scripture, and commitment that an individual or church group could use when seeking repentance. It is modeled after historic Christian practices but adapted to a contemporary context. This liturgy can be done privately, or a pastor could lead a congregation or small group through it. For an individual, you might read it aloud in a quiet room, perhaps even kneeling as a sign of humility.)*

**Opening Scripture:** (Read aloud Joel 2:12–13) *“‘Yet even now,’ declares the **LORD**, ‘Return to Me with all your heart, and with fasting, weeping and mourning; and rend your heart and not your garments.’ Now return to the **LORD** your God, for He is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, abounding in lovingkindness, and relenting of evil.”*

**Invitation:** Leader (or individual prays): “Dear friends (or O my soul), God calls us to return to Him with all our hearts. Let us take courage that His mercy is abundant. Now is the time to thoroughly repent and cast ourselves on His grace. Let us pray.”

**Prayer of Confession (unison or solo):** *“Most merciful God, I confess that I have sinned against You in many ways. I have (confess specific sins silently or aloud…). I have done what is evil in Your sight and failed to do what is righteous. I am heartily sorry and I humble myself before You. Have mercy on me according to Your unfailing love. Wash me clean in the blood of Jesus. I renounce my sin and all allegiance with the devil. I ask You, Holy Spirit, to help me amend my life. I yield to You completely. Empower me to walk in obedience. Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me. Restore to me the joy of Your salvation and sustain me with a willing spirit. I ask this in Jesus’ Name. Amen.”*

(**Personal silent confession** – Take a few moments to privately confess particular sins and failures. Be specific. Envision laying each at the foot of Christ’s cross. After a time of silence, continue.)

**Declaration of Pardon (Leader or self-declaration from Scripture):** *Hear the promise of God to all who truly repent and believe: “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9) And, “There is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.” (Rom. 8:1). In the name of Jesus Christ, by His authority, I declare that those who have sincerely repented and trusted in Christ are forgiven and cleansed. Thanks be to God for His mercy.*

(**Optional Action –** At this point, some tangible symbol can be done. One might write down the sins on paper and then tear it up or burn it (safely) as a sign that God wipes them out. Or one might stand from kneeling as a sign of being raised up forgiven.)

**Renewal of Commitment:** *“Holy God, by Your grace I have died to sin and now live to You. Today I reaffirm that Jesus Christ is Lord of my life. I offer myself – body, soul, and spirit – to be a living sacrifice for You. By the power of Your Holy Spirit, keep me faithful. Strengthen me to resist temptation. Help me put on the full armor of God. I commit to seek You daily in prayer and Scripture. I commit to fellowship and accountability with my brothers/sisters. I commit to flee from whatever provokes my sin and to pursue what promotes righteousness. I cannot do this on my own, but I trust You will complete the good work You have begun in me. I thank You for Your patience and for welcoming me home. In Jesus’ Name I pray. Amen.”*

**Scripture of Hope:** (One or more of the following may be read to reinforce God’s promises.) For example, *1 Corinthians 6:11* – *“Such were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.”*; or *Isaiah 1:18* – *“Though your sins are as scarlet, they will be as white as snow.”*; or *Jude 24–25* – *“Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to make you stand in the presence of His glory blameless with great joy…”*

**Prayers of Petition:** Now, spend time asking God for specific help. e.g., “Lord, fill me with the Holy Spirit. Grant me the gift of purity. Guard my eyes and thoughts. Give me a hunger for Your Word. Surround me with godly friends. Heal anyone I’ve hurt through my sins. Use my life as a testimony of Your restoring grace. Etc.” If in a group, individuals can pray out petitions and others say “Amen.”

**Closing Thanksgiving:** *“Father, thank You for hearing our cries and for your unfailing love. Thank You for the forgiveness and new beginning we have in Jesus. As we leave this time of prayer, let us go forth not in our strength but in Yours. Your grace is sufficient; Your power is made perfect in weakness. We rejoice that our sins are forgiven and that You remember them no more. By the Holy Spirit, empower us to bear fruits worthy of repentance and to shine Your light in a dark world. In Jesus’ mighty Name we pray. Amen.”*

**(Optional)** Singing a hymn like “Amazing Grace” or “Lord, I Need You” can cap the time with worship, sealing our devotion to God.

This liturgy can be adapted, shortened or extended as needed. The core idea is to walk through confession, receiving forgiveness, and re-dedicating one’s life to God, all done in an atmosphere of worship and reliance on the Holy Spirit. When used in a congregational setting, it powerfully communicates that the church takes sin seriously but also rejoices in God’s grace, fostering a culture where repentance is normal and celebrated.
