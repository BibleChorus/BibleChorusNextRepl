The New Testament also contains conditional warnings in the form of **“if”** statements, underscoring that continuing in Christ is necessary. For example, Paul teaches Timothy:

*“It is a trustworthy statement: for if we died with Him, we will also live with Him; if we endure, we will also reign with Him; if we deny Him, He also will deny us; if we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.” (2 Timothy 2:11–13)*

This early Christian hymn (as it appears to be) contrasts the outcome of **endurance** versus **denial**. Reigning with Christ is promised **only to those who endure**. By contrast, **if a believer were to deny Christ**, Christ will be faithful to His holiness and **deny that person** – echoing Jesus’ own words: *“Whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father”* (Matt 10:33). It is a sobering possibility. Some interpreters soften 2 Timothy 2:13 (“if we are faithless…”) to refer to occasional lapses, saying Christ still keeps us. But the context strongly implies that **“faithless”** (without faith) is parallel to denying Him – hence a final falling away. Christ remains faithful to His threat in that case: He *cannot deny Himself* or contradict His own Word. Thus, even here, with a positive tone of encouragement (*“let’s endure and live with Him!”*), the **negative warning stands**: *we must not deny our Lord*, whether by word or by persistently disobeying Him as Lord. This warning would certainly apply to those effectively **denying Christ by their deeds** (Titus 1:16). The Apostle John likewise wrote, *“If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, **we lie** and do not practice the truth”* (1 John 1:6). **Talk is cheap**; a lifestyle of disobedience “denies” Christ regardless of our church-talk. But *“let everyone who names the name of the Lord abstain from wickedness”* (2 Tim 2:19).
