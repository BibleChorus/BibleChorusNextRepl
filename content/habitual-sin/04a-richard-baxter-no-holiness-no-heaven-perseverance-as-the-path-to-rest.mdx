<b>Richard Baxter (1615–1691)</b>, a renowned Puritan pastor (author of <i>The Reformed Pastor</i> and many others), ministered in Kidderminster with great effect. He is especially relevant to our topic for two works: <i>The Saints’ Everlasting Rest</i> (1650) – a treatise on heaven and how to live in light of it – and <i>Aphorisms of Justification</i> (1649) – a more doctrinal work on justification, sanctification, and conditions of the new covenant. Baxter fought against both the <b>Antinomians</b> of his day (who so emphasized free grace that they denied the necessity of repentance and holiness) and the <b>Papists</b> (who taught works merit salvation). Baxter’s position was essentially that <b>we are forgiven and accepted by God only for Christ’s sake and by true faith – but that true faith is “conditional,” that is, it <i>obliges</i> us to continued obedience, and God’s promise of final salvation is made only to those who overcome and obey (by grace).</b> Baxter’s language can at times sound like salvation by works, but in context he means not that our works earn any merit, but that <b>the covenant promise (eternal life) is made to a <i>qualified</i> kind of faith – namely, a living, obedient faith.</b> Dead faith (intellectual assent without works) he considered no true faith at all. Thus, <i>in effect</i>, Baxter strongly affirmed: <i>“Without holiness, no man shall see the Lord”[<sup>puritanboard.com</sup></i>](https://puritanboard.com/threads/john-flavel-no-holiness-no-heaven.100420/#:~:text=Q,not%20glorify%20him%20on%20earth)</i>, and <i>“only those servants who persevere in faithful obedience will enter the kingdom.”</i>

In <b>The Saints’ Everlasting Rest</b>, Baxter encourages believers to meditate on heaven and live in a manner befitting those who seek that eternal rest. But he also repeatedly warns nominal Christians of missing that rest through sloth or sin. In one poignant passage, Baxter imagines what it will be like for a godly soul to reflect on how close he was to hell but for grace. The saved soul will think: <i>“Yonder was the place that sin would have brought me to; but this is what Christ has brought me to! Yonder death was the wages of my sin, but this eternal life is the gift of God… If I had continued in my [unconverted] state, I would now have been in torments… Who made me to differ? O Lord, <b>surely it was Thy free grace alone!</b>”[<sup>ccel.org](https://ccel.org/ccel/baxter/saints_rest/saints_rest.iii.III.html#:~:text=from%20that%20to%20which%20we,Who%20made%20me)[ccel.org</i></sup>](https://ccel.org/ccel/baxter/saints_rest/saints_rest.iii.III.html#:~:text=it%20that%20Christ%20hath%20brought,Who%20made%20me)</i>. Note, Baxter fully credits grace for the difference – but he emphasizes the real <b>danger</b> the person was in while in sin.

Baxter famously exhorted self-examination. In *Saints’ Rest*, Chapter 8 (on “The People Who Receive the Rest”), he basically presents **tests of genuine faith**. He insisted that *many* will miss heaven because they were *self-deceived* about their faith. Here is a powerful excerpt:

*“It is a most lamentable thing to see how most men do spend their care, time, and pains for known vanities, while God and glory are neglected… If God would give them leave, they would rather live here forever, though in no higher place or pleasure than their present life affords, than to die and go to heaven. … Examine yourself: Do you make it your chief business to secure your soul? … Do you heartily renounce all other happiness but that which God has promised? Can you say, ‘There is nothing in this world that I desire, but so far as it leads to God; I could sit down with as much content in poverty, if I might have more of God and holiness with it, as in a full estate’? … If any have more of the government of thee than Christ, or if thou hadst rather live after any other laws than His… thou art not His disciple.”\*\*[<sup>ebooks.regent-college.edu](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/130/#:~:text=feigned%20or%20with%20reservations,it%20the%20great%20labor%20of)[ebooks.regent-college.edu*</sup>](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/130/#:~:text=pardoned%2C%20reconciled%20to%20God%2C%20and,thou%20mayst%20not%20tremble%20with)*

This searching passage (partly paraphrased in modern English) shows Baxter’s pastoral heart to <b>unmask false Christians</b>. He basically asks: What do you truly love and live for? If you’d rather enjoy earthly ease indefinitely than go to be with God, your heart is not fit for heaven. If you don’t <b>renounce all other “happiness” except what is in God</b>, you are an idolater at heart. And that last line is a direct quote from Baxter: <i>“If any have more of the government of thee than Christ... thou art not His disciple.”[<sup>ebooks.regent-college.edu](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/130/#:~:text=own%20way%20%3F%20This%20is,approach%20ofdeath%20and%20judgment%20may)[ebooks.regent-college.edu</i></sup>](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/130/#:~:text=feigned%20or%20with%20reservations,thou%20mayst%20not%20tremble%20with)</i> This comes straight from <i>Saints’ Everlasting Rest</i> and is Baxter’s application of Luke 14:33 (unless a man forsake all, he cannot be Christ’s disciple). Baxter allows no divided allegiance. If Christ is truly your Lord, He must rule your heart supremely. If some sin, habit, or worldly goal dominates you more than Christ, <i>you are no true Christian[<sup>goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7646575-if-any-have-more-of-the-government-of-thee-than#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIf%20any%20have%20more%20of,%E2%80%9D)[goodreads.com</i></sup>](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7646575-if-any-have-more-of-the-government-of-thee-than#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIf%20any%20have%20more%20of,%E2%80%9D)</i>. That is a thunderous wake-up call, very relevant to one enslaved to pornography. We can rephrase Baxter: <i>“If lust has more of the rule over you than Christ does, do not deceive yourself: you are not a Christian. You must repent and yield to Christ’s lordship, or you have no part in Him.”</i>

In <i>Saints’ Rest</i>, Baxter also stresses that <b>perseverance to the end is essential</b>. He writes, <i>“Not every one that runs will win the prize, but those who run lawfully and so run as to obtain[<sup>ebooks.regent-college.edu</sup>](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/131/#:~:text=Not%20to%20every%20one%20that,upon%20him%20his%20new%20name). It is not enough to begin in the spirit, and then end in the flesh. <b>He only that endureth to the end shall be saved</b>… There is no crown for starters, but for finishers.”</i> Baxter often used the metaphor of <i>a race or warfare</i>. He exhorted that many seem to begin well (like temporary believers in the parable of the soils), but only those who press on and overcome will get the reward[<i><sup>ebooks.regent-college.edu](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/131/#:~:text=Chap,man%20knoweth%2C%20saving%20he%20that)[ebooks.regent-college.edu</i></sup>](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/131/#:~:text=Not%20to%20every%20one%20that,upon%20him%20his%20new%20name). For example, he references Christ’s promises in Revelation: <i>“Not to every one that presumptuously believeth, but ‘to him that overcometh’ will Christ give the hidden manna… he shall eat of the tree of life… shall not be hurt by the second death… Christ will confess him before the Father… and make him a pillar in God’s temple… and grant him to sit with Him on His throne”[<sup>ebooks.regent-college.edu](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/131/#:~:text=is%20of%20great%20importance%20to,upon%20him%20the%20name%20of)[ebooks.regent-college.edu</i></sup>](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/131/#:~:text=will%20Christ%20give%20to%20eat,throne%2C%20even%20as%20he%20also)</i>. Here Baxter quotes the very passages we mentioned from Rev 2–3[<i><sup>ebooks.regent-college.edu</sup></i>](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/131/#:~:text=Not%20to%20every%20one%20that,upon%20him%20his%20new%20name), emphasizing Christ’s <i>conditional</i> <b>“if you overcome”</b> as the gateway to these glories. Baxter says pointedly: <i>“Not to every presumptuous believer, but to him that <b>overcometh</b>...”[<sup>ebooks.regent-college.edu</sup></i>](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/131/#:~:text=is%20of%20great%20importance%20to,upon%20him%20the%20name%20of)</i> – highlighting that many <i>assume</i> they have a right to heaven simply by professing Christ, but Christ Himself makes the outcome conditional on <b>victorious persevering faith[<i><sup>ebooks.regent-college.edu](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/131/#:~:text=Chap,man%20knoweth%2C%20saving%20he%20that)[ebooks.regent-college.edu</i></sup>](https://ebooks.regent-college.edu/Baxter-Saints-Everlasting-1830/131/#:~:text=is%20of%20great%20importance%20to,upon%20him%20the%20name%20of)</b>. Baxter delighted in piling up those Scriptures to shatter false assurance and comfort true strivers.

Now, Baxter’s controversial work **Aphorisms of Justification** lays out his doctrinal perspective more technically. Let’s glean some key statements from it, especially as summarized in a guide he wrote. In *Aphorisms*, Baxter explains different “stages” or aspects of justification (forgiving grace) – conditional and absolute. He says, for instance:

- <b>Justification has an initial conditional grant and a final absolute application</b>: <i>“Our justification after faith (in this life) is ours actually, but yet upon condition of perseverance in faith and sincere obedience.”[<sup>reformedbooksonline.com](https://reformedbooksonline.com/on-the-continuation-of-justification/#:~:text=21,%E2%80%A6)[reformedbooksonline.com</i></sup>](https://reformedbooksonline.com/on-the-continuation-of-justification/#:~:text=faith%2C%20or%20before%20they%20have,%E2%80%A6)</i>
- He distinguishes *first faith* (entry) and *continued faith*: *“There is a difference between the initial right to pardon at conversion, and the continued right which is confirmed only if we abide in Christ. The new covenant giveth us right to Christ’s benefits **upon condition of perseverance**.”*
- Baxter goes on: <i>“As there is a great difference between <b>our first title to justification</b> and the <b>continuation and consummation of it</b>; so it is with the conditions thereof. <b>Our first title is upon condition of initial faith (and repentance)</b>… <b>Our continued and consummate justification is upon condition of persevering faith and obedience[<sup>reformedbooksonline.com</sup>](https://reformedbooksonline.com/on-the-continuation-of-justification/#:~:text=27,%E2%80%9D)</b>.”</i>

In plain language, Baxter is asserting that when you first truly believe (and repent), God truly forgives and justifies you. But that pardon is covenantally <b>conditioned on you continuing in that faith and obedience[<i><sup>reformedbooksonline.com](https://reformedbooksonline.com/on-the-continuation-of-justification/#:~:text=21,%E2%80%A6)[reformedbooksonline.com</i></sup>](https://reformedbooksonline.com/on-the-continuation-of-justification/#:~:text=27,%E2%80%9D)</b>. If you were to abandon the faith later (or live in unrepentant disobedience), you would forfeit the benefits – you would not receive final salvation, because the promise of salvation was made to <i>believers</i>, and you ceased to be a believer in the practical sense[<i><sup>reformedbooksonline.com</sup></i>](https://reformedbooksonline.com/on-the-continuation-of-justification/#:~:text=21,%E2%80%A6). Thus initial justification can be seen as <i>conditional/potential</i>, and it is “confirmed/absolute” only after one has run the race. He even says the new covenant itself, while gracious, <b>contains warnings and conditions which if not met will leave a person condemned[<i><sup>reformedbooksonline.com</sup></i>](https://reformedbooksonline.com/on-the-continuation-of-justification/#:~:text=25,%E2%80%A6)</b>. He points to the “accusation of the Gospel for not performing its conditions… from which no man can be justified, and for which there is no sacrifice”[<i><sup>reformedbooksonline.com</sup></i>](https://reformedbooksonline.com/on-the-continuation-of-justification/#:~:text=25,%E2%80%A6) – clearly referencing Hebrews 10:26 (no sacrifice remains for willful sin)[<i><sup>reformedbooksonline.com</sup></i>](https://reformedbooksonline.com/on-the-continuation-of-justification/#:~:text=25,%E2%80%A6). In Baxter’s schema: break the <b>new covenant conditions</b> (persistent unbelief/disobedience), and the Gospel itself accuses you with no remedy[<i><sup>reformedbooksonline.com</sup></i>](https://reformedbooksonline.com/on-the-continuation-of-justification/#:~:text=25,%E2%80%A6). However, he also says that by God’s grace true believers <i>will be enabled</i> to fulfill those conditions (persevere)[<i><sup>reformedbooksonline.com</sup></i>](https://reformedbooksonline.com/on-the-continuation-of-justification/#:~:text=21,%E2%80%A6). Nevertheless, he urges us not to “separate the inheritance from the precepts” – meaning don’t think you get the inheritance regardless of following the Lord’s commands[<i><sup>reformedbooksonline.com</sup></i>](https://reformedbooksonline.com/on-the-continuation-of-justification/#:~:text=27,%E2%80%9D); they go together.

One particularly striking Baxterian aphorism: <i>“<b>He that will have Christ’s blessings must consent to His terms</b>… for it is a ‘marriage-covenant’… If you take Him, He takes you; but if you forsake Him, you forfeit all.”</i> (Paraphrase from <i>Aphorisms</i> Guide, points 20–27[<i><sup>reformedbooksonline.com](https://reformedbooksonline.com/on-the-continuation-of-justification/#:~:text=%E2%80%9C,have%20performed%20all%20the%20conditions)[reformedbooksonline.com</i></sup>](https://reformedbooksonline.com/on-the-continuation-of-justification/#:~:text=27,%E2%80%9D)). This aligns perfectly with what we’ve been saying: <b>an unfaithful bride (professing Christian) who abandons her groom (Christ) cannot expect to enjoy the marriage feast</b>; she has broken covenant. Only those who keep the covenant (by <i>remaining</i> in Christ by faithfulness) will celebrate in the end.

Baxter’s teaching may sound a bit technical, but its practical upshot is captured in his more popular writings and sermons: <b>he relentlessly told people that they must strive for holiness, continue in repentance, and not imagine that an empty faith without works or an initiation without perseverance could save them</b>. This is classically summed up in another Puritan slogan: <i>“No holiness, no heaven.”</i> Indeed, in a catechism on the covenant, John Flavel asks: <i>“Can none be saved without holiness on earth?”</i> Answer: <i>“No adult person can scripturally expect happiness in heaven without holiness on earth; ‘without holiness no man shall see the Lord’[<sup>puritanboard.com</sup>](https://puritanboard.com/threads/john-flavel-no-holiness-no-heaven.100420/#:~:text=Q,not%20glorify%20him%20on%20earth).”[<sup>puritanboard.com</sup></i>](https://puritanboard.com/threads/john-flavel-no-holiness-no-heaven.100420/#:~:text=Q,not%20glorify%20him%20on%20earth)</i> That was standard Puritan fare.
