Finally, we consider **Augustine** (AD 354–430). Augustine’s theology is complex; by his later years, he strongly taught the sovereignty of God’s grace and the “perseverance of the saints” (that the elect will unfailingly persevere). However, Augustine equally affirmed the visible church contains many who are not elect and will fall away, and that **we must not presume on who is elect except by observing their life**. He often preached to warn **against false security**. For example, in his *Homilies on 1 John*, Augustine says:

*“Let no man say, ‘I am born of God, and so I shall not sin,’ ... “Whosoever is born of God does not commit sin”; and yet again the same Epistle says, “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves.” ... “In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God.” (1 John 3:10) ... If you live unrighteously, you seek to be numbered among the children of the devil.”\*\* (Homily 5 on First John)[<sup>newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/170205.htm#:~:text=,He%20that)[newadvent.org*</sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/170205.htm#:~:text=1,shall%20confess%20himself%20a%20sinner)*

Augustine grapples with 1 John’s tension: believers do still sin (venially), but they don’t live in sin. He tells his congregation essentially, *Don’t claim to be a child of God if you are living in unrighteousness – such a life shows you belong to the devil.* **The necessity of living righteously is non-negotiable for Augustine**. In that same homily he declares: *“No murderer has eternal life abiding in him”* (quoting 1 John 3:15) – so if a Christian were to commit murder or hate his brother, he cannot say he has eternal life unless he repents. Augustine did believe if one is truly regenerated, God’s grace will ultimately cause them to repent and not die in mortal sin; but from a human perspective, one who falls into serious sin is on the road to perdition. Therefore he constantly exhorted self-examination: *“Brethren, let us live in holiness, and we shall not fear the death of the body. ... We must fear that death of the soul, which is **sin persisted in without repentance**.”* (Sermon 65).

Augustine also spoke about **final perseverance** in terms of *“he who endures to the end will be saved.”* He wrote in *City of God* (Book 21, ch. 9) that not all baptized will be saved, only those who persevere. He was adamant that **holiness is required**: *“No one denies that good life is necessary for eternal life.\*\*”* In a letter explaining predestination he remarks: *“No one is certain of eternal life, except the one who perseveres to the end; and we see many who are apparently in grace fall away.”* Thus even with his predestinarian view, Augustine acknowledged the phenomenological reality that some real Christians do apostatize (which he explained as they were never truly redeemed, though in our view they were brethren who fell).

But <b>pastorally</b>, Augustine never told people “Don’t worry, you can’t lose salvation.” Instead, he urged them to cling to Christ and <i>use the means of grace</i> (sacraments, prayer) to continue. One of his quotes (if indeed his) relevant here: <i>“God has promised forgiveness to your repentance, but He has not promised tomorrow to your procrastination.”[<sup>fauxtations.wordpress.com</sup></i>](https://fauxtations.wordpress.com/2022/08/31/st-augustine-repentance-and-procrastination/#:~:text=August%2031%2C%202022%20September%2010%2C,5)</i>. This saying (attributed to Augustine) captures the early church ethic: <b>there is forgiveness if you repent, but don’t presume on a tomorrow – repent now[<i><sup>fauxtations.wordpress.com</sup></i>](https://fauxtations.wordpress.com/2022/08/31/st-augustine-repentance-and-procrastination/#:~:text=August%2031%2C%202022%20September%2010%2C,5)</b>. Whether or not Augustine said those exact words, they reflect his spirit in sermons. He often warned against delaying conversion or repentance, as death can come anytime and the state in which one dies is fixed for eternity.

In his *Homilies on the Gospels*, Augustine expounds the parable of the wise and foolish virgins (Matt 25). He says the foolish virgins’ lack of oil (good works) kept them from entering the feast – showing that *profession alone (lamps) without love and fruit (oil) is not enough*. He famously said, *“He who created you without you will not justify (or save) you without you.”* In other words, **our will must cooperate; God doesn’t save an unwilling soul living in sin**.

On apostasy, Augustine considered that those who fall away were never truly regenerate (an early form of “they went out from us because not of us”). Yet, he also said they did receive some grace: for instance, in *Admonition and Grace* he concedes some have *“the gift of faith but not the gift of perseverance”*, meaning they believed for a while but did not persevere. Thus practically, he acknowledges some believers don’t endure and hence perish – which in our terms is losing salvation (though he’d say they weren’t elect to final salvation).

Augustine’s <b>On Christian Discipline</b> (a short treatise) emphasizes correcting sinning church members so that they might be saved “<b>in the day of the Lord</b>” (he cites 1 Cor 5:5). He supported excommunication not to damn but to awaken the sinner to repent and <i>rejoin the path to salvation</i>. This again shows he viewed unrepentant sin as damning unless reversed. In one letter, Augustine laments some loose priests who did not enforce discipline, saying they <i>“kill those whom they falsely assure of life”</i>, very similar to Cyprian’s <i>“false safety”</i> concern[<i><sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050703.htm#:~:text=persuasion%20kills%20worse%20than%20persecution,62%20safety%20is%20taken%20away). He writes, <i>“The unrighteous will not possess the kingdom of God (1 Cor 6:9). They who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom (Gal 5:21). Take heed what you promise; make sure of whom you promise. <b>Certainly, to promise the kingdom to the unrighteous is to kill them outright</b>.”</i> (Sermon 172). Thus Augustine too decries <b>false assurances</b> given to those in deadly sin.

From this survey, we see the <b>continuity</b> of thought from the apostolic age through the 4th century: <b>the church fathers unanimously taught that a Christian must persevere in holiness, and that those who turn back to a life of sin face exclusion from God’s kingdom.</b> Some, like Hermas or Cyprian, expressed it very severely (one chance of repentance, etc.), others like Augustine more gently, but none taught that a Christian living in unrepentant immorality is nevertheless secure in salvation. On the contrary, they explicitly state such a person is <i>“not of God”</i>, “has no eternal life abiding,” “will be cut off,” “shall not inherit the kingdom,” “goes to everlasting fire,” etc.[<i><sup>newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0104.htm#:~:text=Do%20not%20err%20%2C%20my,one%20that%20hearkens%20unto%20him)[newadvent.org</i></sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1701081.htm#:~:text=to%20be%20at%20the%20disposal,fire%3B%20and%20that%20it%20may). They affirmed the warnings of Scripture exactly as written. They also believed in the <b>restorative power of repentance</b> – the door was open for the lapsed to return, albeit with tears and reformation of life. But they urged <b>speedy and sincere repentance</b>, warning that presumption and delay could lead to a point of no return[<i><sup>newadvent.org</sup></i>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/02011.htm#:~:text=day%2C%20if%20they%20repent%20with,promises%20with%20great%20%2044).

Thus, the early church’s message to someone continuing in pornography (to use our case) would be: <i>“Brother, you are on the way of death. Do not be deceived. You cannot have fellowship with God and partake in the devil’s filth. Repent with urgency – cleanse your heart, seek God’s mercy with fasting and prayer. Cut off this sin as you value your soul. Otherwise, be assured that if you remain in this bondage, you will be excluded from the eternal kingdom and find yourself among those in the lake of fire. This is the teaching we have received and which we pass on: ‘No sexually immoral man has any inheritance in God’s kingdom. Let no one deceive you with empty words’[<sup>newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0714.htm#:~:text=And%20the%20way%20of%20death,pitying%20a%20poor%20man%2C%20not)[newadvent.org</sup>](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0714.htm#:~:text=labouring%20for%20the%20afflicted%2C%20not,delivered%2C%20children%2C%20from%20all%20these). So come out of this deceit, mourn and purify your conscience, and <b>God will receive you</b>. But if you persist, you choose eternal death over life.”</i> This is precisely the stance we see from the Didache to Augustine. It is the stance this book urges once again in our time.

In the next chapter, we will hear a similar witness from the **Reformation-era Puritans**, who, like these church fathers, emphasized that only *“holy, overcoming Christians”* inherit final salvation. They too warned professing believers not to *rest on presumptuous grace* but to examine themselves and evidence their faith by Spirit-wrought obedience. As Richard Baxter, John Owen, and others will remind us: *we must “keep our garments white” and hold fast to Christ to the end, for true faith is a **fighting, persevering faith** that results in the **Saints’ Everlasting Rest**.* Those who instead make peace with sin will find in the end no rest at all, *“but only a terrifying expectation of judgment”* (Heb 10:27).
