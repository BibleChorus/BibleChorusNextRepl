This brief book was drafted entirely with the assistance of *ChatGPT Deep Research*, an artificialintelligence tool I prompted and supervised. I chose this method because, after many years as a Christian who once minimized the eternal danger of habitual sin, through God’s great patience and mercy I finally repented and discovered how urgently the church needs a clear, unflinching warning call. AI enabled me to gather Scripture, history, and contemporary data quickly and present them in a concentrated form for fellow believers who may be where I once was.

Sadly, the numbers justify this alarm. <b>Pornography is now mainstream inside the church:</b> a recent Barna study found <i>just over half of practicing Christians admit using porn</i>, with <b>22 percent viewing it weekly or daily</b> [<i><sup>Barna Group</sup></i>](https://www.barna.com/trends/over-half-of-practicing-christians-admit-they-use-pornography/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Even pastors are not immune: <b>67 percent confess they have struggled with pornography</b>, and 18 percent say it is a <i>current</i> battle [<i><sup>Barna Group</sup></i>](https://www.barna.com/research/pastors-pornography-use/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Alcohol abuse tells a similar story. Pew Research reports that among U.S. adults who attend worship at least monthly, <b>13 percent engaged in bingedrinking during the previous month</b>—four/five or more drinks in one sitting [<i><sup>Pew Research Center</sup></i>](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/03/06/americans-drinking-habits-vary-by-faith/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). These figures expose a church culture in which sins that Scripture links to damnation are quietly tolerated.
