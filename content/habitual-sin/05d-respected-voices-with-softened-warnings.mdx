To understand the **breadth of this issue**, we should consider several representative voices from within respectable evangelicalism. These are not fringe prosperity preachers or antinomian cultists, but **mainstream leaders and statements** that carry weight for large numbers of Christians.

One example is the aforementioned <b>Charles Stanley</b>, whose teachings on eternal security have been consumed by millions. His stance, summarized earlier, effectively removes any scenario in which a regenerate person could end up lost. By teaching that even apostasy or “sinning like the devil” cannot cost salvation[<i><sup>bible.lockman.org</sup></i>](https://bible.lockman.org/htm_php-c.php?do=show_node&b=67&c=0&v=0&show_ti=2966&show_ts=1&show_user_id=ca7a55acd81d7f5cdd0c6cff2c0bc96e&show_question_id=17377#:~:text=,Security%2C%20Can%20You%20Be%20Sure), Stanley undeniably <b>downplays the threat of damnation for the professing believer who lives in sin</b>. Listeners inclined to sin find in such words a ready excuse to delay or avoid repentance. It is telling that Stanley felt the need to make such statements—likely to reassure struggling Christians of God’s grace. But in doing so, he (perhaps unintentionally) undermined the very biblical calls to <i>“pursue... sanctification, without which no one will see the Lord”</i> (Heb. 12:14).

Another influential source is denominational literature. The Southern Baptist Convention, as noted, teaches perseverance of the saints. Its wording, while balanced in intent, <b>emphasizes security over warning</b>. The phrase <i>“never fall away… kept by the power of God”</i> in the Baptist Faith and Message[<i><sup>bfm.sbc.net</sup></i>](https://bfm.sbc.net/bfm2000/#:~:text=All%20true%20believers%20endure%20to,God%20through%20faith%20unto%20salvation) rings louder in minds of church members than the clause about believers possibly <i>“falling into sin through neglect”</i> and bringing <i>“temporal judgments on themselves.”</i> Any notion that such sin, if unrepented, could result in <b>eternal judgment</b> is absent from that statement. Similarly, many evangelical churches have doctrinal summaries that assure believers of salvation but do not mention the possibility of apostasy. A church member who reads these summaries would never guess that the New Testament contains severe warnings to Christians. Thus, even at the official level, warnings have been trimmed away.

Consider also the common evangelistic approach of the last hundred years: the *“sinner’s prayer”* emphasis. People are often taught that if they prayed to receive Christ sincerely, they are saved. Follow-up usually encourages joining a church and growing, but seldom includes a *warning* like: *“If you turn back to a life of sin, you will perish.”* On the contrary, new converts are often immediately assured that their salvation can never be lost. While meant to give newborn Christians confidence in God’s grace, this practice has unfortunately produced legions of nominal believers who **recall a moment of decision as their guaranteed ticket to heaven**, even if their lives show no ongoing repentance.

Even some **Calvinist teachers**, champions of “perseverance,” have at times leaned more on reassurance than warning. For instance, a well-known Reformed preacher, aiming to comfort timid souls, once said that **a true Christian who fell into grievous sin would inevitably feel conviction and return to Christ before death by God’s grace.** While this may often be true, it is not a biblical guarantee explicitly stated for every case; rather, Scripture holds out the *possibility* of failing to inherit the kingdom (e.g. Gal. 5:19–21) as a real danger. By constantly assuring “true believers” that they *will* repent eventually, pastors can unwittingly strip these warning passages of their force. Many hear such assurances and conclude, *“Well, I know I’m a true believer—I must be, I had an experience of conversion—so these dire warnings in Scripture must not actually be meant for me.”* This reasoning may not be what the pastor intended, but it is a **pervasive deduction in the minds of congregants**.

One of the most sobering realities is how this plays out regarding <b>sexual sin, especially pornography</b>. Sexual immorality is one of the very sins repeatedly named in the New Testament as soul-damning if unrepented (Eph. 5:5–6, Col. 3:5–6). Yet, in many churches today, <b>pornography among congregants is rampant and yet rarely addressed with warnings of hell.</b> Statistics bear out the extent of the problem. Recent surveys found that over <b>two-thirds of churchgoing men and about half of pastors view pornography regularly[<i><sup>afa.net</sup></i>](https://www.afa.net/the-stand/family/2020/07/porn-and-the-church/#:~:text=%2A%2068%25%20of%20church,damaging%20issue%20in%20their%20congregation)</b>. Astonishingly, <b>69% of pastors say porn has adversely impacted their church</b>, yet <b>only 7% of churches have a program to help people struggling with pornography[<i><sup>afa.net</sup></i>](https://www.afa.net/the-stand/family/2020/07/porn-and-the-church/#:~:text=%2A%2057,has%20adversely%20impacted%20the%20church)</b>. These figures suggest that <b>churches acknowledge the problem’s prevalence but have largely failed to confront it proactively.</b> People in the pews, including leaders, are trapped in secret sexual sin, but structured accountability or church discipline is exceedingly rare. Why? At least part of the reason is that <b>few leaders truly believe these sins put one’s soul in immediate peril</b>. If a pastor were utterly convinced that half his men were on the road to damnation due to porn use, would he not sound a trumpet call of alarm? Instead, the typical approach is to treat porn as a regrettable struggle that “many Christians deal with,” offering private counsel or generic encouragement about God’s forgiveness. The <b>early church’s uncompromising stance</b>—“abstain from fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul” (1 Pet. 2:11)—is rarely echoed with specificity. Pastors fear driving people away with talk of hell, or they assume these men are “saved but struggling” and thus do not press the urgency of repentance. This pastoral hesitancy is a direct fruit of the security-focused theology that dominates evangelicalism. It leads to an <b>absence of church discipline</b> in cases of moral failure. Indeed, one of Bonhoeffer’s charges in <i>The Cost of Discipleship</i> was that <i>“cheap grace is baptism without church discipline”[<sup>thegospelcoalition.org</sup></i>](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/themelios/article/the-skim-milk-gospel-of-cheap-grace/#:~:text=,%28Part%20I%2C%20Chapter%201)</i>. Today, church discipline (publicly correcting or excommunicating unrepentant sinners) is exceedingly rare outside of a few denominations, meaning that a member hooked on pornography is unlikely ever to face official censure as long as he’s somewhat discrete. This would have been unthinkable in the early church (when penitents had to undergo public repentance), but it is the norm now. The implicit message to the sinner is: <i>Your behavior is unfortunate, but not dire. We assume you are still saved; just try to do better.</i>

It is worth highlighting that **not all evangelical voices have remained silent**. Here and there, individuals have decried this trend. For example, missionary-evangelist Paul Washer rebuked modern churches by saying that by **“not preaching on sin, we have done a great injustice to the gospel”** (from *The Cross* sermon). The late revivalist Leonard Ravenhill used to lament that **“the altar calls are full but the alters are empty”**, meaning many respond emotionally but few truly repent and forsake sin. These prophetic voices, however, tend to be admired from afar rather than imitated. The mainstream methodology rolls on, emphasizing **positive affirmation over warnings**. One might attend evangelical conferences, listen to popular Christian radio, or read best-selling Christian books and scarcely ever hear the old echoes of *“If you live according to the flesh, you will die”* (Rom. 8:13) or *“Let no one deceive you… the immoral, impure, or greedy… has no inheritance in the kingdom”* (Eph. 5:5–6). Such verses are in every Bible, but they have almost become the “quiet parts” we don’t say out loud.
