# Forum Voting Feature Implementation

## Overview
I've implemented a comprehensive voting (upvote/downvote) system for the forum feature. This enhancement allows users to vote on both topics and comments, helping to surface the best content through community feedback.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- Created `forum_votes` table to track user votes on topics and comments
- Added vote count columns (`upvotes`, `downvotes`, `score`) to `forum_topics` and `forum_comments` tables
- Implemented proper constraints to prevent duplicate voting

### 2. API Endpoints
- **POST `/api/forum/topics/[id]/vote`** - Vote on a topic
- **POST `/api/forum/comments/[id]/vote`** - Vote on a comment
- Both endpoints support upvoting (1), downvoting (-1), and removing votes (0)
- Implemented transaction-based vote counting for data consistency

### 3. UI Components
- Created a reusable `VoteButtons` component that displays vote counts and handles voting interactions
- Integrated voting buttons into the topic list and comment sections
- Added visual feedback for user's current vote state (highlighted buttons)
- Implemented login prompt for non-authenticated users

### 4. Sorting and Filtering
- Added "Most Popular" sorting option to the forum page
- Topics can now be sorted by score (upvotes - downvotes) or by most recent
- Maintained existing category filtering functionality

### 5. User Experience Enhancements
- Real-time vote count updates without page refresh
- Visual indicators for positive (green) and negative (red) scores
- Responsive design that works well on mobile devices
- Toast notifications for error handling

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Migrations
```javascript
// 20241120_create_forum_votes_table.js
- User voting records with unique constraints
- Foreign key relationships to users, topics, and comments
- Indexed columns for performance

// 20241120_add_vote_counts_to_forum.js
- Added upvotes, downvotes, and score columns
- Indexed score column for efficient sorting
```

### Type Updates
Updated TypeScript interfaces to include:
- `upvotes`, `downvotes`, `score` fields
- `userVote` field to track current user's vote

### API Integration
- Modified existing topic and comment fetch endpoints to include vote data
- Added JWT-based authentication checks to determine user votes
- Implemented efficient batch queries to minimize database calls

## Benefits

1. **Community Engagement** - Users can now actively participate in content curation
2. **Content Quality** - High-quality topics and comments naturally rise to the top
3. **User Feedback** - Authors receive immediate feedback on their contributions
4. **Improved Discovery** - Popular content is easier to find through sorting

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

1. Vote history tracking for analytics
2. Reputation system based on received votes
3. Vote notifications for content authors
4. Time-based vote weighting (newer votes count more)
5. Moderator tools to lock voting on specific topics

## Usage

To use the voting feature:
1. Navigate to the forum page
2. Click the up/down arrows next to any topic or comment
3. Use the "Sort by" dropdown to view most popular content
4. Your votes are saved automatically and persist across sessions

The voting system is fully integrated and ready for use once the database migrations are applied.
