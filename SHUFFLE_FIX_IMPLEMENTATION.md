# Shuffle Feature Fix Implementation

## Problem Description

The shuffle feature had two main issues:

1. **Incomplete Song Pool**: The shuffle only worked with songs currently loaded in the UI (20-40 songs due to pagination), not all songs matching the current filters/playlist.

2. **Infinite API Calls**: When shuffle was enabled, the API was being called repeatedly every few milliseconds with requests like:
   ```
   GET /api/songs?page=1&limit=20&sortBy=mostRecent&sortOrder=desc&limit=112 304 in 111ms
   ```

## Root Causes

1. **Dependency Loop**: The `useEffect` hooks in `listen.tsx` had circular dependencies that caused them to re-run continuously when shuffle was active.

2. **TotalSongs Dependency**: The `fetchAllSongs` function depended on `totalSongs`, which changed with each API response, triggering re-renders and new API calls.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Fixed `fetchAllSongs` Function
- Removed `totalSongs` from dependencies
- Now makes two API calls: first to get the total count, then to fetch all songs
- This prevents the dependency loop caused by `totalSongs` changing

### 2. Used Refs to Avoid Dependency Issues
- Created refs for `fetchAllSongs`, `toPlayerSong`, and `updateQueue`
- This prevents the `useEffect` hooks from re-running when these functions are recreated

### 3. Added Debouncing
- Added a 500ms debounce to the shuffle queue update
- Prevents rapid successive API calls when filters change

### 4. Improved Effect Logic
- Combined multiple effects into one
- Added early return when shuffle is not active
- Added proper cleanup to cancel pending updates

## How It Works Now

1. **When Shuffle is Enabled**: 
   - Loads ALL songs matching current filters/playlist (not just visible ones)
   - Shuffles the complete list
   - Updates the play queue with all shuffled songs

2. **When Filters/Playlist Change During Shuffle**:
   - Automatically fetches new songs matching the updated criteria
   - Re-shuffles and updates the queue
   - Debounced to prevent excessive API calls

3. **When Shuffle is Disabled**:
   - Restores the original unshuffled order
   - Maintains the current playing position

## Benefits

- Users can now shuffle through their entire library or filtered results
- No more infinite API calls
- Smooth performance with proper debouncing
- Dynamic updates when filters change during shuffle
